I ordered again, because I am a dummy and I contradicted myself after saying I wasn't gonna order from them ever again.

I ordered a chicken quesadilla, got it delivered late as always, then IT DIDN'T HAVE CHICKEN IN IT!!! I call back to tell them that my quesadilla was missing the chicken, a girl said "....and you're just noticing that now?", I replied "YES BECAUSE I JUST EFFIN GOT THE FOOD!!!!", then the girl says "ok we'll make you a new one and send it with another driver, then show and give the driver the old plate so that he can confirm." Wtf, why would I lie about it not having chicken? I'm too hungry to be wasting my time calling your dumb a$$es to be lying about there not being chicken in my quesadilla, really broad??

They're customer service skills absolutely suck, horrible!!! Didn't even apologize for the mistake they made, asking me to show the old plate because they think I'm probably lying. Best believe I showed the plate to the driver with the opened quesadillas so that he can see and show it to the girl who thought I was lying about there being no chicken in my quesadilla. 

I am so done with them!!! They're mostly rude Salvadorians who lack customer service skills and don't know how to speak to their customers. They suck. ZERO STARS if possible!!!! What a shame!!!
