Used to come here at least once a week for the past 6 months or so for Spicy Chicken Shawarma....quick, cheap, DELICIOUS. The guy usually on duty was always very friendly and made a great wrap.Then they got new management. I tried to give them benefit of the doubt and came back a couple more times over the course of a few weeks to make sure it wasn't just the new management getting their feet...the service much slower and inefficient and worst of all the shawarma and falafel are nowhere near as good.Sorry Boston Shawarma. You've lost me.
