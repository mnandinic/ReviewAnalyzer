First let me say is never understand how people could write a yelp review because a lot of people fabricate there stories to make it sound worse then what it really was. So for me to write this that means I was completely disappointed in my service. I places my delivery order through eat24 at 930 the restaurant opened at 9 why did it take almost over an hour for my food to arrive?  To top it off everything was cold. I mean cold not one thing was warm. The toast was cold and hard like it just sat and died waiting the rest of the food. I work in a restaurant so I know what died food taste like and my toast was exactly that died food. When I reached out to eat24 about my food they said the restaurant would take off the pancakes for the inconvenience. How about you delivery me a hot plate of food like i ordered. I don't want a refund I want a hot plate of food. But they couldn't even offer that, I would've given the old order back. Just be more aware of your delivery times and have better guest service. Much better places to order from for breakfast its just disappointing that I've given this place so many chances to improve and they just keep disappointing there guest
