Pros - Great atmosphere, the restaurant is very modern and decorated very nicely, staff is friendly and they serve great drinks

Cons - This is not the place to go to if you're looking for good Mexican food, their food was very bland and insatiable, however, they do have cotton candy which was randomly good
