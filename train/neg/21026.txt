I would describe this place as similar to a fast food restaurant in terms of the dining experience, so i am only commenting on the food itself. To be honest I just don't get the appeal. I ordered the large steak, which is a bit expensive (about $9), though admittedly enormous. They use something like a skirt steak, which is rather difficult to chew - every bite i took, the meat came out of my sandwich. The steak was definitely under-seasoned, in my opinion. The sandwich comes with 1 slice of (muenster?) cheese, which seems skimpy for the size of the sandwich, tomatoes, green beans, avocado spread and some sort of special sauce which seemed like a spicy chimichurri. I got the spiciness from the sauce but no flavor, and nothing else about this sandwich brought any flavor whatsoever. Props on the homemade bun, but it just doesn't add much flavor-wise. Just way too boring for my palette (which is by no means advanced). 2 stars because the people were nice, and I know they also offer a BBQ version that I did not try - perhaps that is a more flavorful option.
