Came here earlier tonight for a friend's birthday dinner. A reservation was made for 8pm. We spent 45 minutes waiting to be seated. Excuses were made.... waiting for another party to leave, bla bla bla.... such a disappointing way to start the night. We left and he waitress seriously had he nerve to ask us if we were leaving.... of course we did! Walked right on over to The Cheesecake Factory and had a great dinner there!!!!
