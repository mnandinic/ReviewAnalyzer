In my never ending yelp adventures, I tried this place even though it's so close to my favorite pastelaria that I had to force myself to pass it by (ok, let's be honest, I totally got a pastel after I ate at Maya Sol). I got a chicken quesadilla, it was pretty good. The salsa and fresh home made chips were my favorite part. Not mind blowing, but those were some good chips and salsa. The staff was all pretty straight-faced, making the customer service just "meh." With so many other good places in this direct area, I am not sure I'll make it back.
