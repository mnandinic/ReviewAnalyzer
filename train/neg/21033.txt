First experience ever getting food from here. I was starving one night so I ordered a steak and cheese sub with peppers and onions. At most places they understand that these should be grilled the idiots here did not. The meat was wicked dry and it's like they don't know what cheese is because I didn't see any of this sub. It was cold when it got to me, and it's not that cold out tonight so it shouldn't have been cold when it got to me unless it was siting around for a while. Even though I was starving I threw the whole sub away it looked so disgusting I couldn't even eat it. I don't know about the other food but I can't imagine it's any better there are so many other resturants in the area just go someplace else.
