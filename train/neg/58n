I much prefer giving a 4 star review, but this restaurant just didn't get there.  To begin with, our table in a rather empty restaurant on a Saturday night was along a wall with a line of the dark red paint scraped bare...not a good start.   This was a shame  as the decor was cozy and had a charming feel.  We were greeted by the waiter who could not have been better..very professional and friendly.  Our first course were the fried oysters that were so small that it seemed to me they were cut up and fried which of course made them dry!   Three of us had the eggplant dish that had way to strong a lemon taste and was mediocre.  One had the duck that he said was excellent and prepared perfectly.  Desert was strawberry shortcake made with ice cream that was very ordinary and I believe the strawberries were frozen.  I know that so many people gave this restaurant really good reviews and based on the duck dish they are certainly capable of putting out well prepared food, but something is wrong as was witnessed by a fairly empty restaurant on a Saturday evening.  Hope they can bring it back!!!
