I would like to give this place 2.5 stars.  I've had better, but it was still pretty decent.  I would give them another chance if I'm around, but it's not a place I'm going to be craving.

Contrary to some of the other people here, I didn't actually like the pupusas as much as other places I've been to.  They were more mushy and the flavor was not quite right, though I can't really say in what manner.

We ordered sides of refried beans and cream to go with the pupusas (which we often do).  The beans were on the salty side.  So was the cabbage that comes with the pupusas.  The cream, by itself, was okay, but when eaten at the same time as the beans or the cabbage the salt brought out a flavor of the cream that I really didn't like.  I also felt like the red sauce for the pupusas was watery.  Final thing--some of the tortilla chips were "chewy".

Enough with all of the negativity though.  Some positives:

-The guacamole was fresh and tasty.  It is a good deal at $3 seeing as how you get some chips and salsa to start.
-The chips were the thick "recently fried" kind.  They were not very greasy, which was nice.  It can lead to the problem above, but I'd rather have these chips and have a few of them not be fully crunchified than to have stale restaurant chips.
-The horchata was quite good and not too heavy on any one flavor.
-Loroco!  Any place with pupusas that doesn't have loroco is not a real pupusa place.
