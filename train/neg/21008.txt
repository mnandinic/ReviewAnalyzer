Apparently the Chacarero by downtown crossing has a strong following... I have seen the line wrap around the block in the summer. My initial impressions about the infamous Chacarero is that it is good, but not worth all the hype. I could see myself having this a few times a year, but I would not add it into my regular rotation of lunch places. I guess the fact that I don't like guac.I found ordering extremely difficult if you altered the default chacarero. At any rate it is worth a try.
