In the (Arlington) center and on my list to try, we dined at Tango yesterday night. 
I've waited to come here because the entree prices are a bit steep for my blood.  Anyhow, I overheard they had Kentucky Bourbon Barrel on tap, so I decided might as well kill two birds with one stone.  

The restaurant layout is nothing special and for how large it was, I was disheartened when we seated in the corner (squished by the wall).  Mind you, it was jam packed, that's just where we were seated.  That complaint aside, I enjoyed the live music and chimmichurri table-side.  The rolls were a nice accompaniment, crisp and warm.  

We shared the carpaccio and the Parrillada Argentina.  The carpaccio was fine; thin sliced half dollars with lots of parmesan and capers.  The salad atop it was dressed with a lemon vinaigrette, which I thought was a good match except for it was dressed too much. :(  The Parrillada Argentina excited us, but left us disappointed.  We ordered our meat medium rare, but instead got one piece medium and the other completely rare.  The other grilled meats were lackluster and crisp (i.e. burnt).  I try to not leave meat behind, but I could not stomach any more of these proteins.  :(

I do want to note that while the food left something to be desired, the service was great.

Unfortunately, this was a miss and while the chimmichurri is slightly better than mine, I'd much rather spend 'dining out budget' on other fares.
