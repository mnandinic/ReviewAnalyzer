As a vegetarian, this place is pretty lame. They were out of omellettes and for $6, I thought my sandwich might come with sweet potato fries but they were out of them when I went back, by 12:15.The sandwich was avacado spread on bread (which was the best part), cold green beans, a few tomatoes, a slice of cheese, and salt and pepper. They also had red peppers but that wouldn't have saved the sandwich. It was bland and slimy and made me wish I had gone anywhere else. My non-veg friends had better luck but it wasn't enough to redeem this place. The spicy sauce was really flavorful but too spicy to put all over the sandwich to give it more umph. I was really disappointed that they didn't even try to to make it better. I should have gone with the plain bread on my first instincts. It was the best part of the meal.If I had to go back, I would try their breakfast options but I don't really feel like paying $7 for pancakes for lunch.This place had so few options, they should have stayed a street cart...
