Meat.  That's basically what is served here.  Was unimpressed with the food on 2 separate trips.  First time around we got 2 filets, way undercooked, extremely chewy, horrible cut (I doubted that it was even a "filet").  The sauce was good but not nearly enough to cover the crappy steak.  At 32$ a piece we expected steakhouse quality but this was nowhere near it.  Second time around we tried meat variety grill.  Basic grilled food.  Pork Chops were tasty and had a good rub but everything else was just meat on a grill.  Chicken bland, Beef Short Ribs just as much fat as meat.  The variety grill comes with some interesting food, but we didn't like any of it. It included kidneys, sweet bread (cow glands here), and blood sausage.  Not for the faint of heart.  On our second trip, the table next to us sent back their steak to be cooked because it was raw in the middle (deja vu of our first trip).  Do they really not know how to cook a steak?  Bread with dip at the beginning of the meal is very good.  Sides (pure poteno and veggies) are also very good but the entree is where you need to impress me (especially at 22-32$ per plate).  

Service and atmosphere here are excellent.  Service is just helpful and attentive enough without being pushy.  Highly recommend Anthony here, he was excellent.  Host marked us as a no show on OpenTable which I had to dispute, not a nice way to end the evening.  

There are tons of good places in Arlington, this isn't one of them.
