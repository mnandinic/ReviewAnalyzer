I'll have to try this place again, but the first time I went there, I ordered myself a dehydrated heart attack.  The food was way too salty and greasy.  I ordered food from the buffet like options and did not try any of the made to order options, which I probably should before I completely make up my mind.  Anyway, I wouldn't really recommend the buffet options.
