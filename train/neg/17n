I had dinner there recently and was unimpressed. This place is essentially an argentinian steak house yet my sirloin was a relatively mediocre cut of meat and though I asked for true medium, it was medium-well done. I might have said something about it if the waiter had come by to ask us how are meal was but he did not.The sides were OK. The wine selection reasonable. Oh, and they forgot to serve us the salad we ordered.
