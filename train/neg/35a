So the other week, my gf told me about a place in Chelsea that sells Puerto Rican food. Seeing as neither one of us have had Puerto Rican food, we looked it up and swung by that night to try it out. The sign said open, the doors were unlocked, hours said they were open to 8, and we walked in at 7:45. Two women sitting at a table reading magazines say they're closed. Confused, we left.

Fast forward to tonight, when we decide to give it another shot. We made sure to get there plenty early this time. The lady behind the counter was extremely nice. She apologized to me for not speaking much English (not that I cared), and explained to my gf (a Spanish speaker) the different types of food. She answered all of our questions, and we decided to settle on the mofongo plates. I got the steak and onion, the girl got the fried chicken. 

When the food arrived, the first thing we noticed was the garlic on the mofongo. The entire top was colored white from it. My goodness, I love me some garlic, and it was almost inedible. I mixed it into my steak and onions, which cut down on the strength. The steak was a real thin, grisly cut of meat. My second bite in was a chunk of fat. I didn't expect much out of it considering the price, but I didn't expect that. My girl couldn't get past the garlic, and didn't eat much. The server asked how we liked it (since we both said we'd never had it before), and my gf said it had too much garlic. Our response was "Then take some off. Lots of people around here like it with a lot of garlic." Thanks?

To top it all off, at 7:15, the ladies behind the counter started cleaning the serving area. A family walked in at 7:30 and was told they were closed for the night. Guys, if you don't want to stay open till 8, change your signs. Very simple. I'm not entirely sure how they get away with doing this. Whatever the case may be, I won't be back.
