For a Mexican margarita spot, it wasn't Mexican at all. The set up was more like a lounge that wanted to seem more posh if anything. Okay, maybe I'm just being bias about the place because of the service we received. We went there for my friends 23rd birthday and met up with some other friends as well. We had ordered one drink each, we got mojitos, and they were okay, if it wasn't for the very unfriendly blonde bartender that served them to us. Her very essence seemed miserable and unpleasant and had a horrible vibe. We kept drinking our drinks and then finally our friends arrived. The birthday girl ordered drinks for all of them and we started taking pictures and having a decent time, despite of the crappy music. Then some guy comes up to my friend, and tells her he needs to talk to her after she finishes, and after she's done taking pictures, he tells her that the manager and the bar tender don't feel comfortable with her there. She had only had one drink. Figures. We all end up going. And long story short. Lolitas isn't that great of a time and I should've listened to my friends when they told me the same thing! Never ever going there ever again.
