A friend of mine told me about this restaurant and I went with a friend and her child, first of all not apropriate for kids, too many drunk, lound rude guys, they were swearing and we felt so unconfurtable. over the top prices i almost fell of my chair when they gave us the bill. we had been to other spanish restaurants ordered the same amount of food and we never had to pay so much.
I ordered soup it was call mondongo, I've try this soup in other restaurants and here in LA Reina restaurant the soup had a funky stinky smell, I could tell that the tripe was not clean corectly, i could smell the tripe in other restaurant you don't smell the tripe because they clean it good, here it was stinky could not drink it, it grossed me out, money wasted, my friend ordered fried cheese sticks with other stuff can't remember, but everything was overcooked almost burned. gross. 
If you don't want to over pay for your food, and likes to go to restaurant with your kids I DO NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant. so sorry LA Reina.
