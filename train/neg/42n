I've been to this restaurant twice and both times have had terrible service and mediocre food.  The first time my steak came out extremely rare (ordered medium).  The waitress offered to throw it back on the grill, which took a good 45mins, and brought the plate back out with just the steak, no sides.  The owner offered to take the meal off our bill, which was a nice offer, but never came through. 
The second time, I sat at the bar and ordered an appetizer.  When the bartender brought it out he noticed there were to many empanadas on the plate and proceeded to remove one and eat it behind the bar!  I live walking distance this place and want to like it, but the waitstaff is unprofessional and the food is not worth the money.
