i was disappointed in this place.  I went in and tried their tamale de pollo, the yellow rice, and their handmade tortillas.  I found all lacking and barely edible.  My preference for Northern Mexican Mountain style cooking aside, the stuff i tried just wasn't good.  The tamal was soft and gooey and not wrapped or steamed well.  The filling was alright  but they cheaped on the flavor.  The rice was good at first then started to leave a starchy pasty feeling in my mouth and had the texture of being out of a box.  The tortillas were like edible cardboard.   I did not try anything else.  These 3 dishes are pretty good gauge for REAL mexican food and they so failed. Any one can do tacos and burritos.   I will have to say that the prices are awesome.  I only wasted $3.36 on this crap and the tamale was full sized.  I will also comment that their meat products looked and smelt good.  I'll have to that next.
