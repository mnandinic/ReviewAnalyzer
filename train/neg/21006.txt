DO NOT GO HERE. I made a Yelp account just to review this restaurant. I heard such amazing things about it and decided I needed to try it today. To start, the staff is the most unfriendly and unhelpful people I have ever met. Secondly, my sandwich was completely mediocre, I could have made better myself. My sweet potato fries were soggy and cold, AND my meal came to $16!! What a waste of money, but all means avoid this place they have gone seriously downhill.
