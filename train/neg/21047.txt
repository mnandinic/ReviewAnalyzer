Punjab palace's food might be ordinary but the service is awful. I ordered a takeout with just 3 items and it took more than an hour. All the while the manager was assuring us that the order will be there in 2 mins, but it never came! The worst part though was that the manager kept lying to us instead of giving us a reasonable estimate and when we got impatient after an hour, he said the bread basket I taking time so he will cancel it to get rid of us. Who can eat indian curry without bread? I have seen busy restaurants but there is a way to keep customer satisfaction and the minimum you can do is be courteous to the customer and Not lie. Irrespective of how the food is, the experience has left a bitter feeling.
