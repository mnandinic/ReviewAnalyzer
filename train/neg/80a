Although my friend and I have been here multiple times with a great outcome, tonight was very sub par.  First, our server took over 7 minutes to greet us.  She then proceeded to "forget" to enter our appetizer and did nothing but apologize without even trying to get a manager involved.  We asked many questions about the menu and she was very unclear and short responded when answering our questions. Food was good, service was terrible and if I ever get the same server I will request a new server or decide to leave.  It would have been nice for her to alert management of our situation, and though it was not even busy refused to do so until I had to run around and find a manager by my self.  Sad trust, very disappointed, might be a while u till i ever risk this place again...
