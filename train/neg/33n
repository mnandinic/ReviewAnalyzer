Went there to celebrate a birthday.  All entree's are $20 plus but this is not a $20 entree restaurant.  The atmosphere is casual (there was a couple making out at the bar) and the service was ok.  There is no kids menu as well so be prepared for that if you are bringing the little ones.

I had the steak which was good but again, overpriced.  I would not repeat or recommend.
