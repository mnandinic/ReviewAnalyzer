 waiter who kept LYING or was being helpful?? either way i'm not coming back

got a table so we could order munchies (WARNING: i felt sick afterwards)
---ancho chile chicken quesadillas: BLAND & looked deceivingly crispy, but wasn't 
---chorizo nachos: tasted horrible & REALLY? 6 tortilla chips?! we asked for more but the waiter said they "threw out the chips for the night" THEN came back saying he had the chef "fry some fresh"... but the chips were cold?

ALSO i asked for hot sauce for my bland quesadillas & the waiter brought mango hot sauce that the chef made "especially for us" but since i'm allergic to mangoes i asked if he had another & he brought out a new bottle of something he "just happened to find in the kitchen"

BEWARE: my friends ordered margaritas by the pitcher & the waiter poured everyone a cup, then took the pitcher away before it was empty & NEVER brought it back

the scene: not as lively & packed as I would imagine Saturday night to be, but maybe that's Boston for you?
