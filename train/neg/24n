Eh. I doubt I will return.

The food was fine. There is basically a choice of various meat dishes and some seafood. Almost everything is grilled with a little seasoning. My lamb chops were tasty as was my husband's skirt steak. There is a nice list of Argentinian wines. Appetizers are large. 

However, for the price (entrees mostly in the mid-upper 20s) I was underwhelmed. One can get something a lot more creative in that range in numerous restaurants. I can grill a quality cut of meat at home just fine too. 

What really turned me off was the noise level. The restaurant is big, the tables placed close together, and the clientele did not help with the atmosphere. One family next to us brought a baby on a Friday night..thanks. The other couple next to us just sat there glued to their smart phones the entire time. I know this is not the fault of the restaurant, but clearly people do not view this as anything upscale despite the prices and one can simply have a better experience elsewhere.
