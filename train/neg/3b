The food was pretty gross and portions were small.  Ordered through foodler.com and it took about an hour to be delivered.  I got an order of steak fajitas, chips, salsa, and guac.  The steak in the fajitas was incredible gristly.  There was a good amount of meat and veggies, but the order came with only 2 tiny tortillas.  Weirder, the tortillas were really really thick - think flatbread - and therefore split in half when I tried to wrap my fajita together.  The chips were a tiny portion and the salsa and guac were probably a tablespoon each in tiny little plastic cups.
