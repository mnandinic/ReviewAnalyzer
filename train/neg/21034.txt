Food was decent.  Customer Service sucks!  I ordered for the first time today for delivery.  The delivery guy named Sammy (or Hammy, whatever it was) couldn't find the building I was in.  He parked in the wrong parking lot and had to just turn one corner.  He parked in the middle of the street, made me come out to the middle of the street when it was pouring rain and then he continued to cuss me out about how he doesn't have time to be finding my building when he has another 30 orders that night.Good: the foodBad: The guy who cussed me out, they gave me 1 napkin for 3 meals, the guy who made me stand in the middle of pouring rain to cuss me out, and the fact that he didn't even say sorry for being late or for pissing me off.Coming back? NO. NEVER. even if the food is good.  I'm not buying a meal there to pay for an arrogant a**hole's paycheck.
