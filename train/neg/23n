This place has lost its allure. We just put down $140 for a dinner for two and it was well below average.  First and foremost, we ordered a hearts of palm salad for $15 - it consisted only of 3 hearts of palm sliced in half with russian-like dressing drizzled on top - what a rip off!  We also ordered olives and they were ice cold - ick!

45 minutes later we got our entrees and our medium rare $25 - $35 steaks were all medium well.  I decided to keep mine but my husband sent his back - so I had my entree but my husband did not - very lame.

Finally, after some wine and beer my husband ordered 2 cokes - and we were charged about $3 a piece.

This place is very over-priced and we will not be going back.
