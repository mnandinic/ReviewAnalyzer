Went there for the first time this past weekend and was not impressed. I thought the owner who works the reservations was rude.  For the price they charge he made it a very uncomfortable environment.  All he did was yell and was rude to his staff - he actually came up to our table and yelled at the waitress in front of all of us.  Our waitress was very nice! Also we made reservations almost three weeks ago and they sat us in a created table that we spent time the whole dinner dodging wait staff, our chairs bumped by staff and customers. The food for the price was OK bottom line wouldn't waste my time or money to go back. 
I did not like the owner.. he needs to learn to CHILL
