God, it's hard to give this place 2 stars because the burgers are so good!I ordered food online at about 630pm for delivery. By the time 8pm rolled around we we at Mama's Place to pick up our grub (just 2 burgers). So we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes to find out it hasn't even gone out the door yet. Rather than wait longer for the delivery guy to get back, we decided to pop in the car and go pick it up.Keep in mind we paid online so we already paid the tip to the driver as well as the delivery fee.When we got inside we asked for compensation, but they only agreed to give us 1 piece of cake. Which we didn't want, but it was a take it or leave it opportunity.Well thanks a lot Mama's. Not going back.
