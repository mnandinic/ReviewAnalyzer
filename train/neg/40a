Moving from Colorado to Boston was a real shocker. Out west Mexican food easily makes up 50% of our weekly diet, so I was really happy when I discovered that "the best Mexican restaurant" in Boston was literally a block from my apartment. Boy was I bummed when I discovered what "the best" had to offer.

Let's start with the basics. First off, I know good fresh produce is expensive and hard to come by in Boston, especially in fall and winter, but guacamole made with anything but fresh avocados is just not worth the effort (or calories). Sour cream should be thick and creamy, hard to get off the spoon even, not watered down so you can squirt it onto food with a ketchup bottle. Burrito meat should be lean and sliced thin, that way,when someone takes a bite, the burrito doesn't get disemboweled all over your lap. Your basic Enchiladas come with red sauce, Enchiladas Suizas come with white; you have to tell people "suizas", it's important. Salsa ought to come with everything ordered. 

Typically, spice and flavor ought to be involved in every dish. Cumin, Coriander, Cilantro, Peppers, Chiles, Lime and Salt are common flavors in Mexican food. Good luck finding any of these flavors at El Pelon. My Enchiladas (Suizas, unexpectedly) tasted like a half empty roll of paper towels smothered in Elmers.

Besides the fact that the food is Bostonian-Mexican (read: awful), the service is glacial even when you're the only customer, and there's a grand total of about 3 tables inside, 4 outside. If you drove here, good luck finding parking, even residents can't find spaces.

I guess the moral of the story is: don't take New Englanders advice on Mexican food. Sorry guys.
