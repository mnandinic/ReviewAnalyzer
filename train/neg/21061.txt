Ugh... don't. Just don't go here.As Alyssa F. pointed out, their food is "unspectacular, but edible." I would like to add to that statement and say "edible, but indigestible."The place is dirty and a bit ghetto. I'm not sure their sanitary conditions are up to code, but ok I'll let the health inspector make that judgement.They don't accept credit cards, cash only, which would be fine if I ever carried cash on me. The owner said the credit card machine is broken but I'm convinced he's lying because if he really wanted to he could have had it fixed by now. I went back over a 3 month span and the credit card machine was still not working...It's the year 2009, if you can't accept Visa or MasterCard I don't understand how you intend to survive as a business.
