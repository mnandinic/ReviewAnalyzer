The ambience was lovely, and the service was fine, but the food was just meh. The best thing we had were the empanadas as an appetizer. Flaky, tender, nicely seasoned filling...delicious.

However, the grilled pork was tough and dry - we had to dunk it in a sauce to make it palatable. The bread they gave us was weirdly cheap too...it had no flavor or color to it. I almost wonder if we got the wrong dish by choosing the pork. Oh well. We generally felt we paid too much for what we got.
