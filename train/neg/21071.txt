I didn't much care for the service; the guy seemed unable to hear me when I asked for water THREE times.  Not only that, but when I asked for water for my friends, he pretended to ignore me and only gave me one glass.The shawarma was average at best; I have definitely had better Middle Eastern fair on the West Coast.  If this is the best Boston can muster up, well and good.  I was just not impressed.
