They don't know how to run a business. They will claim the wait is over an hour on a busy night, yet they will surely have 10+ tables open just "waiting" for the reservation to show up late. I have been there three separate nights, and tables were empty for AT LEAST 30 minutes while we waited each time. They are clearly a new establishment, having taken over the old Paparazzi spot -- it shouldn't take this long to realize you are driving away customers. The food is good, but not worth the wait. For a better experience, go down the street to Zocalo
