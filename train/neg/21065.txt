Disappointment. Lamb/beef shawarma is under seasoned and is not  authentic shawarma- it's gyro meat. I could've gone to a Greek place if I wanted a gyro...The guy initially refused my credit card for my $7 sandwich- saying no credit cards for less than $10. I put my credit card away and gave him a $10 bill instead. He very annoyingly asked if I had singles instead. When I said no he asked for the credit card back.... Very strange.Bad service and bad food.
