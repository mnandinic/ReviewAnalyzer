I always see lines at this place at lunch time so I finally decided to try it.  I got the basic chicken sandwich and it was extremely bland. I noticed that the staff added salt to each sandwich when making it and I thought was odd but after I tasted it I understood why. I am not sure what kind of bread this sandwich has but I had flower (or something) dust all over my hands after touching it. There is also very limited seating which is annoying. They have added bar type seating right next to where the line to the counter is and no one sits there because people are moving in line behind you. I could not help but think if someone from Chile came here they would not come near this place.
