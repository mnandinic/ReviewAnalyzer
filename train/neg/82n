Haven't been to this restaurant in almost 2 years now. In the past the cashiers were extremely rude and would ignore you even though most of the time they were standing around talking to friends or making a personal phone call.  Another thing I disliked about this place was how long they would take to make a sandwich. Even when they were empty it would take over 30 minutes. From reading recent reviews it seems nothing has changed. My sister also stopped coming to this restaurant due to the attitudes of the cashiers. Glad I stopped coming here!
