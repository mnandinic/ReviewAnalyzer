This is more of a pick up bar- meat market. This is not an intimate restaurant where you enjoy quality food. There's a lot of attention paid to presentation, not flavor. My drinks were extremely sweet. My cocktail and sangria were as if someone left the Cotton candy to melt in them. The hot sauce was barely mild, other ribs were slathered in a sweet sauce that was not flavorful. The food is eclectic- not Mexican. The only thing Mexican about this place is the tequila menu. Don't try to pronounce any item with proper pronunciation as the wait staff will not know what your talking about. The cotton candy would have been adorable- if I were in middle school. We had lobster tails that were spicy, but not flavorful. It was as if hot sauce and spices were just thrown on with out thought. It could of been chicken as I couldn't taste the lobster. I won't be going back. This place is definitely marketing to an 18-25 crowd with money who don't know any better when it comes to food.
