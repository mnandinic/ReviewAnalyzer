DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME COMING HERE.  I was DISCRIMINATED significantly and was not served alcohol just because it was Saint Patrick's Day.  The Frizzy haired, uneven eyebrowed waitress said "we can not serve you because you came off the street from Saint Patrick's Day."  Seriously?  We are being discriminated for being Irish and celebrating our heritage?    I then consulted with the Assistant Manager and the GM and they stood by the DISCRIMINATING waitress.  There are plenty of better restaurants in the area to enjoy EXCEPT LOLITA.
