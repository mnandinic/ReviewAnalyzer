I'm finally taking down my score for this place solely based on what I'd consider questionable pricing practices.Not only do they steadily increase the cost of the sandwiches at what appears to be an annual rate, they now charge for the extra hot sauce? I'm not talking about extra in terms on quantity, which they didn't do before either unless you wanted a container of it, I'm talking about spice level. And how much do they charge for seriously less than a teaspoon of the stuff? $0.75. The exact sandwich that used to cost around $8 (and less a few years ago) now costs exactly $9.55. I understand that overhead costs increase, whether it's rent or ingredient prices, but I find it hard to believe that justifies what seems like a 10-20% increase seemingly every year. Cost of living increases tend to be 3%... I'd probably be less peeved if they actually posted that "extra hot sauce" now costs more somewhere, but it's not listed anywhere except on your receipt as they hustle you on your way.Good bye Chacarero. Your sandwiches still are yummy, but your pricing changes, particularly unadvertised new costs, leave a bad taste in my mouth.
