I'm not sure why this place has such a high rating, but it left much to be desired. The level of spice is good but the dishes themselves were sub-par. The chicken tikka saag and shahi paneer were average or below average. They also failed the ultimate test for any Indian restaurant - the venerable Gulab Jamun. It was BAD (of course I still finished it, after all its sugar). There are definitely some things to like about the place - The service is excellent and the wait staff is friendly. Its also not the usual decor that most Indian restaurants have. I guess they just need to fix the food. Sounds easy enough.
