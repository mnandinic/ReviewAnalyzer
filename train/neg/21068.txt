Terrible experience.1. They think you're an idiot.I ordered a roll with lamb shish kebob (clearly described on the menu as chunks of meat grilled on a skewer) and the younger cook started to slice off meat from the cylinder of shawarma. I said again that I wanted lamb shish kebob, not shawarma, and he finally admitted that the shish kebob wasn't available today, so I agreed to the shawarma, but that's not the end of the story...2. Lamb and beef are the same according to the owner.I bit into my "lamb" shawarma roll and noticed that the meat had no taste of lamb. Furthermore, the meat was very salty and had a texture similar to spam/sausage/hotdog. Whatever it was, it was not lamb, and not even real (unprocessed) meat. I looked at their shawarma setup and realized that they had only two cylinders of shawarma. One was white meat (chicken) and the other was dark, and now the question was whether that's lamb or beef, since both were on the menu. I asked the owner, and he reassured me that the meat I had was indeed lamb. But then I asked him where the beef shawarma was, and he said, looking away, that it was half beef and half lamb! Apparently you get the same thing when you order either!3. The owner basically told me not to come back.Clearly dissatisfied with my food, I pointed to Garlic and Lemons in Allston as a desperate measure to prove that shawarma can be done better. The owner said that it was owned by his cousin and I should just go there next time. Well, I definitely am not coming back to Boston Shawarma anytime soon!
