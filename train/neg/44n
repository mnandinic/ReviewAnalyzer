Worst service I've had in a long time.  25 minutes before anyone came to our table and we were never checked up on.  had to flag down for bread and our late bottle of wine.  The decor is cheap, atmosphere is lacking.  There isn't even music playing lightly in the background.

Entrees were great: FIlet with roquefort and lamb chps, but prices range from $15-$40.  Not very consistent.

Didn't see any desirable apps.  Wine list had good variety, but would jump up from a $30 bottle to $285 bottle all over the wine list.  This is not a place I would come to get a $300 bottle of wine.  We're in the suburbs.

Bottom line, the entrees were great but I had a very disappointing night overall and I won't be returning
