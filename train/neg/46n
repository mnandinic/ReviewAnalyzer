Never again!  I've been going to Tango since it first opened as a 1 room operation.  This place was fabulous.  

Now, it's all about quantity of people, instead of quality food, ambiance and service.  We went last night with reservations.  Sat us 30 minutes later after I said something to the host.  He was rude and said he was still seating people with earlier reservations.  If you can't handle the amount of people, then don't overbook and/or don't accept walk-ins!  

Service was super slow as the placed was overcrowded.  I don't think there would have been enough time to evacuate if there was a fire.  The two hosts were running around with their heads cut off.  Had no clue what was going on. I've never seen this place so poorly run.  

We ordered 1 appetizer and a salad to share, a steak entree for each of us.  The salad came first, but 20 minutes later.  The salad was a pile of leaves and that was it.  I don't think they washed it either.  The appetizer came 30 minutes later.  Another joke.  The waiter told us it took so long because they had to melt the cheese.  Huh??  Another 40 minutes go by, and our steaks arrive.  Mine was medium instead of medium rare, and husband's was medium rare instead of medium.  At this point, we didn't care as we were starving.  None of the items were anything special.  For the money they charge, the dishes should be memorable.  It wasn't, as everything was bland.  No seasonings.

There was only one bus boy and 4 waiters running around.  Our salad and app dishes didn't get picked up until after the entrees came.  On our way out, both hosts ignored us, and didn't even bother to greet us goodnight, or ask how everything was.  

Save your money and your time.  We finally left after 2+ hours.  All these years, I've been raving about this place to friends and family.  No more.  I'm recommending they go elsewhere.  I wish I could get back the 2 hours I wasted here.
