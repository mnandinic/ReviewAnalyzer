I've been wanting to go here for sometime since I hear it's great food.  The food is GROSS!!!!! Family meal & added one xtra side almost $30 really, you should have paid me! 

The food was not even warm and dried out. The chicken was so crisp that it had no meat, the plan. were burnt and a chemical taste to them, the fries were dried out, the tort. werent even completely cooked, & the bread where's the rest of it. 

SO GROSS!!!!!!!! I'D RATHER EAT AT KFC!
