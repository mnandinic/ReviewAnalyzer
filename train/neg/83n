The sandwiches are good, and the prices typical for the area, and all in all it's a good concept (which is why it is franchised all over the damn place), but... my god, you guys have to move faster.

I am not looking for McDonald's speed.  I'm reasonable about the tradeoff between made-to-order quality and time.  But well over 20 minutes after my order, when there's not another customer in the place, there should be either signs of my food coming, or some acknowledgment that it's taking too long.  

The business here is essentially take-out (though there are a few tables), mostly sandwiches, generally a lunch place.  In other words, people are going to stop in while in the middle of their day, not when they want to relax over dinner.  This fact has not sunk in at Tostado.

It;s a shame, because I do business regularly in a place that makes Tostado a no-brainer for lunch.  Unfortunately, I can't really go there anymore, because they just take too damn long.
