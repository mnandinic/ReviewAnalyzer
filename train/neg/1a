Food is decent, but speed & ability to get order correct is wrong 100% of the time.

We waited 1 hour & 55 minutes on a Sunday night for food.  It arrived @ 9:55pm.

Burritos contained rice, despite all caps request for NO RICE PLEASE.  The same thing happened during an on-site dining experience.

They forgot the flan, but charged me for it.

(I recall seeing a fellow yelper from Medford with almost identical complaints.  I should have heeded his warning).
