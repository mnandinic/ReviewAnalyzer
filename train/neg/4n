I am really surprised by the good reviews. I have been dying to go here because of all the great reviews. We went in and it was so hot it was like a sauna but it is 78 degrees today. Placing our order was ridiculous and we speak spanish. The owner had to come over and ask us what we wanted because the lady could not understand what we were asking for. Since we were literally reading off the menu it wasn't like it was something she wouldn't understand. I ordered a fish dish and they just made whatever they wanted, not what was on the menu. In the 40 plus minutes we waited for our take out the 3 couples sitting at the tables were so annoyed that 2 of them got up and left, even while there food was cooking and the other had to replace their order twice. I don't know what was going on but it was ridiculous. The food was pretty average. I guess if you don't know a lot about South American food and you live in the burbs this place is special but there are so many better places in Boston.
