So disappointing!

We visited Tango on a recent Friday night without a reservation and were seated immediately.  We were off to a good start, but that's where it ended....

We waited forever for our waiter to take our order.  I ordered a steak and I can honestly say it was one of the worst steaks I have ever had.  And when you are going to a STEAK restaurant, that isn't what you would expect!  It was fatty, grizzly, and just gross.  Hubby ordered chicken and it was not fully cooked.  Our waiter never asked if our food was ok.  If he had, we would have voiced our concerns.  But since he didn't seem to care, we just wanted to get out of there.

Again, we waited forever for the check.  With just two entrees and one appetizer, our bill came to over $60, plus tip.  Very pricey.  Especially since you can get a better meal at Ninety Nine.

We won't be returning.  Save some money and eat somewhere GOOD.
