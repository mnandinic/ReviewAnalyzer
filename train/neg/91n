Everything was ok until my 3 year old pulled gum from under the table and said "mommy look play dough I will play with it" . I made him stop and look under the table and for my surprise it was covered with gum. I look for a table without gum and for my surprise all of them have gum stuck under the table. I ordered huevos rancheros and a side of bacon, the two good things were the refried beans and the plantain. Everything else either didn't have flavor or was disgusting. I know that Latinos back home on lower end places tend to stick their gums under the table but at least someone scrap them out every day. I would never came back to this place as I can just imagine how they clean their kitchen.
