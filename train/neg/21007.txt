I have been to this lunch place three times. The food is consistent. Consistently underwhelming. I simply had to try this Downtown locale after hearing many rave reviews from both coworkers and friends, as well as reading a glowing review from the Phantom Gourmet. While the line was long and the prices were on the expensive side, I am always willing to forgive these road bumps because it simply happens to every well publicized dining establishment. What I am not willing or able to forgive however, is a measly taste return on my dining investment. Every time I have dined here (I've had both types of meats), I find that I am actually BORED with what I am eating before I finish half the sandwich. As a point of reference, the last time I've been bored eating my food was when I had to eat PBJ every single day of middle school. Nothing about this sticks out, including the "spicy" sauce, except the overhype surrounding the place. I can only hope that this one star review provides me a little measure of revenge for all the friends I've had to cut ties with because of their unfortunate recommendation.
