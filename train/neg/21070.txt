Neat little hole-in-the-wall place, with tables and a big ass TV.  The man working the coutner was very friendly and the service was good.  My experience with the felafel sandwich however was.. meh.  Falafel was sort of spicy but just not... quite... good.    Sandwich was messy and sort of hard to eat without covering myself in hummus (which.. I did).Boston Shawarma is good for a quick fix, but if you're looking for a better Middle Eastern place in the city, head over to Cafe Jaffa.
