Something's strange about this place, based on the reviews. As of this writing, Guanachapi's has a 4 star rating on Yelp (something many of Boston's best restaurants haven't achieved), but the food is barely edible. This wasn't the sort of experience that there could be two opinions about. The cook did not try and fail. There was less effort and finesse than a school cafeteria meal.

The chips (stale and bland) and salsa (so bland and watery it couldn't really be called salsa) were a bad start. I'm not one of those people who complains if food isn't blistering hot, but this was about 1/10th the flavor of a mild supermarket salsa. Enchiladas were so tough I could barely saw through the cheese (same bland sauce as the salsa), my husband's chicken had no seasoning, and rice was just a plain pile, as were beans. I have no idea where the yucca and plantains in other people's reviews came into play.

I've eaten in lots of good restaurants in Central America, so I can't accept that this place is "authentic." Authentic does not mean the worst ingredients and cooking available in a particular country.

Maybe there's some secret to ordering that we didn't hit on, but I don't think so. Other reviews have complimented the enchiladas and beans, and the descriptions don't come close to matching what we had. My only guess is that there's a bad cook in the rotation who literally can't even make salsa. Regardless, I recommend avoiding this at all costs. It wasn't even cheap.
