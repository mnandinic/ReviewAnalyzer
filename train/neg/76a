Sooo Lolita s was one restaurant in Boston that used to be my go to place over the weekends. Every friend visiting from out of town, I would proudly take to Lolita s. Obviously I don't think the same anymore. 
My reservation was taken at 8pm Saturday evening and I was told that my table would be ready in 45 minutes. I wait for a message to come for 45 mins and when it didn't, I went to the front desk and asked if the table would be ready soon cause it was way past 45 mins. This is what the lady at the front desk says ' may be you didn't understand what I said before - I said 1 hour 45 mins not 45 '. Pretty racist thing to say to an Asian.  really Lolita?? Are u being this kind of restaurant now? And it wasn't just me and my friends! We over heard another party that intended to get seated this Saturday but was given a reservation for next Saturday! Who does that?!! Thumbs down Lolita s.
