I LOVE Mexican food... but this was hands down, the worst I've ever had. We tried to place an order for delivery over the phone and confronted a really awkward and unbelievable language barrier and breakdown in communication. The guy taking our order was clearly carrying on a conversation with someone across the room, and even after spelling the street name twice, he was still completely dumbfounded. While this should have been a red flag, we opted to drive there for order & pickup.

We ordered breakfast (Huevos Rancheros & Huevos Picados), and wished we hadn't. Everything was overcooked. By a lot. The scrambled eggs were grayish brown. We picked, but nothing was worth eating. There was not one redeeming quality of the meal. Not even a stoner with a killer case of the munchies would stomach this garbage --total waste of money, total waste of time.

I don't know how their other food is, but I'm more than satisfied with never knowing.
