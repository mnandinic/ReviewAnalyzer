What a strange place. You order a burrito here, and in no way take part in choosing what goes inside. Twenty minutes to a half hour later (we were the only ones in there, so not sure why it takes so long), we received our burritos. Basically, it's a chicken and rice dinner wrapped in a burrito wrap, then seared on the flat top grill. 

It was tasty but not what I expected for a burrito. It was warm, not hot. It was cheap, but took way too long.
