Sigh, I went to this place 2-3 years ago, and still remember it. Not in a good way however. Food, was, like many are saying, quite bland back then, and I see this hasn't changed at all if I see some of the other reviews. It would have been alright if the service wasn't abysmal. Bullied for 2 hours by different waiters, when that didn't work, they started with my parents. You could argue that things have change by then, but I'm not making the effort of ever coming back. I'm just glad these people are still stuck in that "place". It's all very sad since they told me this was a good Argentinean place given the fact that I'm one myself.
