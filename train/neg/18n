Sadly as an Argentine I was disappointed. First I had the milanesa with fries. The Milanesa was pure breaded with a paper thin beef, that's now how we do it in our country unless you are trying to extend that beef such that you can cut cost.  Fries, were frozen out of a bag, they had no mashed potatoes only sweet mashed potatoes, in Argentina  we always have rustic mashed.  Empanadas were fried, prefer them baked but were ok. Overall my experience was not great, I'll go back for the lomo and parilla possibly one day but probably only because that's the only argentine restaurant really in the state. Suggest for owners, do the upgrades, quality will always shine. Use real fries not frozen potatoes, add some meat to the milanesa.
