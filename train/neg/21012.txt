Color me confused.  Having read glowing reviews on Chowhound and here on Yelp, I was psyched when an errand brought me to this part of downtown around lunchtime.  I grabbed my honey, who conveniently works nearby, and headed to Chacarero, ready to bask in the South American scrumptiousness.Now I'm back at my desk, still shivering from the cold, full, yes, but distinctly underwhelmed.  My BBQ chicken sandwich (get the small--it's plenty for lunch) was full of components that should have been full of flavor, but were bland bland bland.  There was a touch of nice spice from the hot sauce, a hint of sour from the sad greenish-yellow tomato, a thin vinegary taste from the BBQ sauce and otherwise ... nothing.  How can avocado spread have so little flavor?  How can grilled chicken be so dry and tasteless?  How come people love this place so much?
