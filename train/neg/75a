If you are young and would like a trendy place that you are willing to stand outside in the cold in a line like an idiot this is the place for you.  When you walk in, picture the "plastics" from the movie, "Meangirls" greating you.  The ring leader who greets you with a fake smile holding an Ipad along with her 2 minions standing next to her.  If you are an actual mature adult and would like to go to a nice restaurant to dine this is not the place for you.  My girlfriends and I decided to have a mom's night out and had heard this was a cool place to try.  Two of us arrived first.  We were told that we could get a table but could also order the full menu at the lounge in the back.  We headed to the back and ordered drinks while we waited for our third party.  While enjoying our drinks, we were able to get a seat in the lounge area.  So, we decided to stay.  We ordered food and a pitcher in anticipation for friend's arrival.  When she finally arrived, she was not let in and told she had to stand in line for 10 minutes.  I quickly got up to go get her and told the security at the door that our party was already inside and ordered food already.  I was directed to the hostess and she told me at this point that if we were not at a table, my friend could not come in as it is a "fire code."  She kept repeating this in a very snobby tone.  I explained that we had already ordered food and drinks but she kept going back to us not having a table and it being a "fire code."  What difference is it letting one person in whether it be for a table or into the lounge?  It is still one person.  I would not return to a place that does not know anything about customer service and how to treat their patrons who are spending money at their establishment.  I am embarrassed with the way we were treated.  Especially being that I was the one to recommend this horrible place.
