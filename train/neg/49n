I'm not sure what happened to this place. Maybe new owners? new chef? But the quality of the food has gone waaaaay down. We went on a Saturday evening, and although we hadn't come to this place in about a year, everything looked the same and we were excited to have delicious Argentinean steak. I got a Churrasco (medium rare) which I've ordered numerous times before. When we got the meal my steak was unevenly cooked - half medium rare and half medium well. The seasoning was extremely bland compared to my past visits as well.

I'm disappointed.. Another great restaurant down the tubes :(
