RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!  And sub-par food!

I would give this place zero stars if it were possible.  My wife and I had been to this place a number of years back (before they expanded the restaurant) and thought it was pretty good, so we decided to go back in April or May 2012.  

We both ordered steaks to be cooked medium rare.  It took forever for our food to get to us (at least 30 minutes), so I was concerned that the food was going to be overcooked by the time it reached us.  Sure enough, when the food finally arrived, we cut into it and it was medium-well at best (not very red).  We told the waitress and she was happy to take our food back.  

About 10 minutes, a man approached our table to talk to us about the food.  Instead of apologizing to us, he was extremely rude.  He told us that we were wrong and that our food was indeed cooked medium rare, and that he would cook the next steaks rare for us.  

His bluntness caught us off guard, and we later told our waitress about this.  We asked the waitress if he was the cook.  No... he was the OWNER!

The owner's rudeness was extremely unprofessional and unnecessary.  Needless to say, we will never go back there again.

On a side note, my wife and I went to Buenos Aires in 2011.  Tango does a disservice to Argentina and does not even compare to the amazing food we had there.
