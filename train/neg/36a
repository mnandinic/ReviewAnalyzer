I wish I could give zero stars...but not possible. This place is not even good as a last resource. The food taste and looks like it's reheated a few times. They look like don't want to toss away food and try to sell it the next day. It's just plain nasty food. Second, omg....the service!!!, how can you work in a restaurant serving customers with NO customer service whatsoever!. The attendant so RUDE and unfriendly, making weird faces every time asked a question about certain food...advise...don't like your job simply quit and find yourselves a job in a cubicle with no public interaction of any kind. Let's make it simple, if you enjoy paying for what it looks old food, extremely rude service and overly priced greasy old food come and make yourself comfortable at this place. There are definitely way more better places than this place. Don't forget...even Market Basket sells nicely fresh cooked food and with nice clean tables and perhaps great service for lower prices.   :)
