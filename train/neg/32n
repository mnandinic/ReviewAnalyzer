I was very disappointed with this restaurant. I thought it would be great given some of the good reviews on Yelp. We came on a Thursday night. There wasn't a long wait to get a table. When we sat down, we ordered an app and two entrees (some breaded beef filet). Entries are $20 and up. Not cheap at all. The waiter got us our water and apps and just disappeared.  Never came back to check on us or to refill our water glasses. Never gave us any bread. We waited over an hour for entrees to arrive and it didn't even taste that good. Some of side dishes were lukewarm at best. 

So the bottom line is if you are looking for good decent food with prompt service at decent prices then you should look somewhere else. At the price they are charging there are plenty of better alternatives out there.
