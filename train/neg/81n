Seriously?! Has anyone here had a sandwich before? No, but really?

I have no idea how these reviews happened. Like none, at all. This place is gross. The meat is bad, the sauces (mostly ketchup) are bad, the cheese is...well, its hard to ruin cheese, but you get the idea. 

Ordered pickup from here, roommates and I got 3 different things, and each hated our own as well as one another's. The meat smelled like something really really funky and the vegetarian sandwich, which only had tomatoes, onions, and cheese in it, was so full of ketchup you could barely taste anything else. By far the grossest experience ever. Seriously, how does someone mess up a SANDWICH this badly?! HOW.
