Not. Impressed. 

I lived in the good ole' east 'ville for two years, but was closest to the amazing Taco Loco, and were not just regulars sometimes I felt like lifers.... Went here the other day because parking around Taco Loco was non-existent and I wish we had parked a mile away and walked. Seriously. 

I got a adobada (pork) taco and a Queso Con Loroco pupusa, which are my two favorites at our usual local. Both were subpar. The taco was on a tiny tortilla with sad toppings, and tasted old. The only saving grace was the meat which was flavorful, but not what I was expecting. The pupusa tasted like it may have been frozen, and was under cooked. To make matters worse the curtido tasted like american coleslaw not the tangy, oh-so delicious pickled taste I'm used to.  Salvadoran salsa is generally more watery than most, but what I was served was like 'salsa juice' and it had no other flavor other than 'liquid' which isn't even a flavor.
