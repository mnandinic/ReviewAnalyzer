Mediocre-to-bad food. I ordered a falafel plate and a side of yogurt and mint via Foodler's delivery service. The falafel were dry and tasted somewhat stale. The included side of vegetables was bland. The yogurt was absolutely too gooey and tasted a touch sour, with no redeeming spice combination.The only thing I liked was the rice.. but how much is that saying?
