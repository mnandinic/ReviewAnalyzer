I haven't dined in, but I ordered some food from Punjab Palace.The food was delivered very hot and very fast--both good things.  However, the quality of the food is not what I was expecting.  Nothing had very much flavor, and there were a lot of bright, unnatural, colors.  I ate the food and it was alright with the pickle that came along with it...but my husband declined to eat anything even though he was hungry.  It was, shall we say, rather unappetizing though perfectly OK.Just had my first experience with Punjab Palace and I am already extremely disappointed and I haven't even touched the food yet. The delivery has taken over an hour to get to my home when my apartment is only located 15 mins away, but I was okay with this as long as I got my food. The delivery man called me an hour later and said that he was lost. So I tried to guide him but he continued to raise his voice at me a few times. When he finally found my apartment he parked on the other side of the street and started complaining about being lost. After I paid him he asked if I had ever ordered from them before and I said no it was my first time (probably my last time now). He said that they don't deliver here. If that is something they don't do they should have simply said it over the phone. Simple as that.
