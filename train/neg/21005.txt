This isn't a review of the food - that would be a 5.  I've been coming here for years and it's my favorite sandwich in the world.  This is a review for the shady gift card practice they employ. I was given a $10 gift card here and when I went to use it I ordered my regular small chicken, which is $7, or about $7.15 with tax.  Chacarero refused to give me the difference in cash or credit, so instead I was forced to spend the entire thing at that visit, or lose the money.  I think this is an outrageous and nefarious way to run a business. My guess is that they can't properly account for gift cards on their books, but the transaction left a very bitter taste in my mouth (which was promptly washed away by the delicious hot sauce). So, please don't purchase gift cards to Chacarero until they sort this out, or unless you know you will be spending more than $10 on your visit as that is the only denomination of gift card they offer. I wish it weren't this way!
