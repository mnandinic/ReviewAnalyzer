Meh.  I wanted to love this place, since it's so close to my house.  I've gotten take-out from there twice now, and "meh" is all they get.I've had the chicken tikka appetizer, onion bhaji, chicken tikka masala, channa saagwala, and chicken saag.  The saag was bland,  and the chicken tikka appetizer was really dry (note, it's not tikka masala, and has no sauce; it more closely resembles tandoori chicken).  The channa saagwala (chickpeas and creamed spinach) tasted inexplicably like chocolate, with large chunks of overpowering ginger.  I enjoyed the bhaji, and appreciated that it came with all of the standard dipping sauces/chutneys.I was most disappointed in the chicken tikka masala; the sauce separated and had a very strong vinegar flavor, and none of the mild creaminess it usually has.  All of the flavors in the meals were just off, and I feel no desire to try Punjab Palace again.Not to mention, it's really expensive.  They charge $12.95 for entrees that Rangoli (the Indian restaurant that used to be there) charged $8.95 for, for far poorer flavor.On to find a better place to get Indian take-out from!
