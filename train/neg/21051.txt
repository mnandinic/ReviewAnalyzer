The food was fine, but certainly not worth the terrible service.  They told us that take-out would be ready in 20 minutes, but it wasn't finished when we got there.  They told us "just a couple of minutes more", but it ended up being another half an hour.   And since there's no place to park, we had to double park and then keep running in and out. Completely unacceptable waste of our time.
