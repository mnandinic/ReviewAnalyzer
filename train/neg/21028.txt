I always wondered why there was those insanely long lines in Downtown Crossing for Chacarero's....then it closed abruptly. I was suddenly quite concerned about what in the world those dedicated Chaca fans were now going to go feed on during their lunch breaks. Without having eaten there, I couldn't fathom how one could spend so much time of one's break queing for a chicken sandwich. Until a friend and I stumbled across the alternate Chacarero location on Province Street...and we just seemed to end up in the line...and then just somehow ended up ordering these strange bbq chicken bundles of amazingness....and all of a sudden were eating one of the tastiest lunches around. Whoever thought to put green string beans in a sandwich, should be given a medal. Along with all the goodness piled into that bread...it is a Chilean marvel. I'm going to go line up for another one. Now.
