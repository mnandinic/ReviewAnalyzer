When I ordered online and realized the delivery would take over an hour and a half a few streets away I called to pick up. I had a hard time explaining that I had already placed my order, but went to pick up anyway. 

I stood at the counter for about 10 minutes while the women at the register was on the phone and the other 3 employees were just standing behind her staring at me. Once off the phone I wasn't acknowledged until I asked twice if she could help me. I don't think one word came out of her mouth the entire transaction, although I am bilingual. 

Very inexpensive food, and the restaurant itself was colorful and looked like would be a good place for a quick dine in. Although, I paid for what I got, very plain, no salsa with the chips, and very dry quesadilla. Perhaps dining in I may have gotten all the extras I needed?
