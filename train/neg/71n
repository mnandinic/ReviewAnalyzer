Guanachopis has better papusas. I asked for crema and she gave me sour cream! I swear it's because I don't speak Spanish while I as trying to explain the cream that the dish already comes with. They have the crema cacique they've sold it to me before. Had to eat my corn tamales with freaken sour cream like really ?
