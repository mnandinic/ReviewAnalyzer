Came here on the East Broadway Foodie Crawl and it was one of the more disappointing Mexican places we went to. I had a quesadilla with green beans in it and there was no flavor in it. I looked to the table to add something to it and what do I see? Ranch. Random. 

I also had the fried squash which I've never had before and was not a fan of. Weird texture. No flavor again!
