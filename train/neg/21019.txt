Okay two stars seem harsh but honestly I paid over $10 for a sandwich I wanted it to be something amazing but it was okay.  It was good but it was not worth $10.  I got the large combo b/c I wanted to have it for both lunch and dinner but unfortunately it only filled me up for lunch b/c i found myself not full after eating half.  I am a petite girl, I don't usually eat a lot for lunch and I wasn't famished either.Even though this is a take out-ish place but I was hoping for a better atmosphere.  I was hoping they were more friendly to a paying customer! I asked for extra spread at least 4 times to 3 different people and either none of them knew what I said (with my hand spreading guestures) or they simply wanted to ignore me.  Finally one guy screamed "one dollar! one dollar!".  Seriously over 11 bucks for a sandwich...no thanks! Did I mention this place is cash only?  Then I asked the cutting guy to cut my sandwich to quarters (as he normally cuts in half).  He ignores me again, after 3 or 4 times he said "this sandwich not for you".  He could simply just said "OK"  or nod his head.I wanted to run out of there as fast as I could and never come back.
