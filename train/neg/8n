Came here for a New Year's Eve dinner with my fiance's family. This was perhaps the worst meal I have ever had, bar none. Waited for a long time even though we had reservations. 

They simply couldn't handle the number of patrons they wanted to serve. I ordered a steak with roasted vegetables. Steak came out over done even though I specified medium rare. Veggies were soggy and tasteless. The server couldn't understand our order. Everything about the meal was terrible. And the best part is that it cost over $500 for 5. What a waste of money.
