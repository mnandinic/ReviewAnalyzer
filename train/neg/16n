Let me say at the outset that I live in Arlington and generally do all I can to support local restaurants. I visited Tango with friends last Saturday night and was pretty disappointed with the experience. First of all at 7 p.m. they were already out of potatoes, the heart of two of their signature side dishes. We ordered some empanadas and they came right away, but not the bottle of wine we also ordered. It came after the appetizers were already eaten.  Then we ordered our main course, mostly steak related dishes - their specialty. Forty minutes later the main courses still hadn't shown. The place was only 1/2 full so we asked our waitress what the delay was. Instead of saying she would look into it, she took out her ordering iPad and began to dispute how long we had been waiting. The food was fine but we were all in a bad humor by the time we ate. Needless to say we chose to forgo dessert. I tried to speak with the manger/owner about our experience but he was very busy so we just left. In the end I felt badly because two of the people with us were from out of town and I wanted them to like one of our local eateries.
