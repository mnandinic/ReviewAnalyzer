Called to make a reservation for May 23rd, more than 2 weeks out. I know it is Memorial Day weekend but the hostess were not helpful at all. I had to call three times, got placed on hold and then hung up on twice. Finally the third time I called they asked for how many people, I responded 5 and said May 23rd. They asked what time and I said 7pm. She immediately responded that they were already all booked for that night...it didn't even seem that they checked the book, and why would they ask me the time if they already knew they were booked for that day? Seems like a very difficult place to get into.
