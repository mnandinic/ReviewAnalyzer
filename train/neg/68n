I heard about Mi Tierra from several different people raving about their authentic Guatemalan and Salvadorian cuisines. And when I realized that this place is literally right around the corner from my house, I decided I needed to give them a try. Picked up their menu one day and ordered from them a couple weeks later. 

Much to my dismay, I was actually not at all impressed at all. Of course, I should probably make it known that I am from NY (LI to be exact), where there are a lot of Latin Americans around which includes Guatemalan, Salvadorian, Puerto Rican, Mexican, Dominican, Brazilian, Chilean (is that a word?), Argentinian, Venezuelan, well you get the point.  So maybe I was bias because I know of the cultural flavors and pretty much grew up around it. 

While the staff is super friendly, please note that I had ordered take out for my meal, and so I can not review of their sit-down service. My meal was $9.95 and there was in fact a ton of food. However, quantity does not make up for quality. I had gotten one of their traditional combinations: "Aguacate Y Chicharrones" - which basically was fried pieces of pork, white rice, refried beans (which I didn't touch because it was like a block of beans and had no flavor at all), and half an avocado. This also came with a cup of watered down salsa and 2 fresh made corn tortillas (which were pretty thick and wasn't all that good - I ended up taking 1 bite and throwing the rest out) and a couple of limes. 

The only way this dish was edible was throwing on some hot sauce on the fried pork, mixed it up with the avocado and squeezing the lime over it. The pork was very bland and hard to chew on and definitely needed to be jazzed up. 

Good Latin food should not need to be covered up by any other flavors, but unfortunately, this was one of those times. I don't think I'm gonna be back, since I can find better Latin food elsewhere and probably for cheaper.
