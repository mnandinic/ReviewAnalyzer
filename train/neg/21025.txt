Didn't meet the hype in my opinion. I got the vegetarian sandwich and it has green beans, tomato, and a couple pieces of marinated pepper. Really boring and flavorless, I couldn't believe that was all the sandwich consisted of.It's not toasted or grilled, just served room temperature on bread. Really nothing special, I'm not sure what all the five star reviews are about.
