Unbelievable bad experience for the 5th of May. I arrived at 9 pm and after putting the name on the list I waited until 11,35 without being seated or advised on what the status of my reservation was. The excuse was that a Rex Sox player was there so they could not find a table anymore. Seriously? Everyone has been so rude because on this particular day the restaurant was obviously full, so they forgot about how to treat regular customers. I won't be bothering them anymore. I'm not a Red Sox player - but they didn't even bother asking who I was...way to go Lolita. Love your approach. Bye
