This place advertises that they deliver...yet the delivery person is never available. The excuse is always that this person's car broken down or that he/she was involved in a car accident. Seriously? Next time I place an order over the phone, I wish they'd just tell me they don't deliver. That way, I can spend the next 15 minutes of my time looking into ordering from a different restaurant.
