I could not agree more with some of the other postings. I am not sure about lunch but the breakfast food is something that I wouldn't even feed my dog. I could barely eat the food as it was so bad. The women who work there are some of the unfriendliest people I have had the u comfortable pleasure of interacting with. 

They barely understand English as well as have little understanding of what you are asking. Service was poor and took them forever to get something. Most of the tables were emptying out and the we had multiple people bringing things and mostly the wrong things.  

Morning restaurants seem to be few on Moody Street on Sundays. I would stay away from this nasty and unfriendly establishment.
