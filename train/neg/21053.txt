Perhaps I got my food on an off-night, given the other reviewers on Yelp. Or, maybe it's because I'm from San Francisco, and am used to really plentiful, extremely delicious AND reasonably-priced Indian food restaurants (the same quality as in England). But, Boston, (speaking to the city of Boston, right now - smile-),  I just don't know. I just haven't had a really good Indian food experience, Punjab Palace included. This was not a good deal, despite fast service (and delivery through Mixed Menu). The Chicken Tikka Masala was so dry, I had to keep drinking water to push it down my throat. The sauce was spicy but not flavorful. The Palek Paneer was edible -- an interesting mix of flavors, and it wasn't bad, just a small portion for the cost. I liked the rice and the (plain) naan, and I know the prices for Indian food are higher in Boston than SF, but it's still high for what I got.
