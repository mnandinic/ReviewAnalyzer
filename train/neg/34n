Maybe I just had a bad experience, but I don't think I'm going to be going back. We were there on a Friday and our food just never came. We had just ordered a bunch of and they came like once every 20-40 minutes for about over an hour and a half.

The waiter was apologetic, but it just got old really fast. Plus, he was insanely hard to get a hold of. We wanted to ask for the check and waited something like 20 minutes just to get his attention. The food was good, but not worth suffering through that service. Although to be fair, I think the food issue was not his fault, I think it was the kitchen.

Maybe just never go on a Friday?
