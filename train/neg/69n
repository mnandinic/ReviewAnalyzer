Ok, now I'm officially disappointed.  

Got the churrasco again for dinner tonight (take-out), but it was seriously different from the first time.  My steak was beyond well-done (I requested medium).  The meat was crumbling off and little dried bits of meat were just falling off like sawdust as I sliced each piece. 
My green onions (grilled scallions) were more like re-constituted scallions that were once visibly dry and off-color.  The two puny stalks left me wondering... 

Was my first time really so much better than this, or is my memory playing tricks on me?  Was I just extremely hungry my first time?  Or was the steak truly cooked perfectly, charred just enough on the outside to lend a noticeable textural difference with a crunchy seasoned crust and chewy juicy meat on the inside.  Were the scallions then truly green and luscious and bigger, grilled to a yummy blend of smokiness and onion essence? 

I am left without answers, as I seek solace in the only thing done correctly.... piping hot, steamy, moist, chewy tortillas.  Dipped in the true stand by - le crema.  

The once-again smushy plantains prove last night's visit a disappointment, and I wonder what I can do to ensure the delicious churrasco plate I had tasted my first time.
