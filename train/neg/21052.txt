I'm giving 2 stars because my boyfriend grew up on chapati and liked theirs a lot, but our experience was terrible! The delivery guy accidentally took our food that we were picking up. Not a problem, we paid for it and asked for it to be delivered. They didn't suggest this or apologize. Then the food didn't show up, so I called them and was basically told they were to busy to call the driver, no apology again. This was not ok so we ordered from Rangoli and went to get our money back. While on the way they called us and said our food was there and we could now have it delivered or pick it up (an hour and a half after I ordered it). No thanks we wanted our money back. That took some convincing also not ok they screwed up. The delivery guy was super nice and apologized so we got the food for free, but seriously whats wrong with the rest of the staff? The food was cold and super greasy, it tasted like bad chinese takeout. Treat me crappy and give me good food and I'll come back (Diva) treat me like crap and give me crappy food, no way. Sorry I cheated on you Rangoli, I've learned my lesson.
