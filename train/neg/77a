My party of 10 couldn't even make it into the restaurant, even though we had a reservation to celebrate my friend's birthday. The bouncer accused my friend's I.D. of being fake, even though it was absolutely real and the I.D. was just issued in Puerto Rico, where she's from. They definitely need to hire more people with cultural appreciation and global awareness. Disappointed.
