maybe i'm just a spoiled shawarma snob. after spending a month in israel, i had the best of the best and even some not so good. however, even the not so good were better than here!this is NOT real shawarma. it was disgusting. chunks (not shreds) of beef in a pita with lettuce and tomato covered in SALAD DRESSING in a stale pita roll! no thank you! i was expecting some place with the title having shawarma in it to have semi-decent shawarma. this wasn't shawarma. it is a shame to shawarma everywhere!never again.
