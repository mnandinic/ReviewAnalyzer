The food came in an hour and 45 minutes!!! It came cold, and with attitude from the delivery man. Its the second time I've ordered from here. I gave them a second chance because the first time I ordered, it was rush hour. But after ordering at 1 pm on a Saturday I'm convinced that they are awful at it. Don't order from here if you want your food to arrive the same day as you ordered it
