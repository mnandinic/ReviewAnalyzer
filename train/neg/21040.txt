I hate to be in disagreement with the other high praise this place gets but I try really hard to like it here but it just isn't happening.I've been about half a dozen times now and every time there is an issue. There is always a service problem with the food sitting on the counter for a while while I look at it wondering if anyone who works there is going to notice and give it to me. The last few times I've gone and ordered french fries they've been under cooked and when I ordered the chicken gyro, the chicken was not well prepared in that there was still a lot of nasty parts still attached.This time when I went, I let them know the last few times I was in the fries were under cooked and if they could make sure they weren't this time I would appreciate it. They had changed the fries since the last time I was in and this time they were delicious and perfectly cooked. On the other hand the fish I had ordered to go with them is under cooked and still in my oven baking.As most of their business is take out, and by the time people get home to realize there is an issue, they aren't going to go back to get it corrected (especially if they are walking, like I am) so Mama's Place really needs to step it up in terms of the quality of food going out before they pack it up.I keep trying with this place as it is a family owned restaurant and I try to support my neighborhood places, but they are making it really hard.
