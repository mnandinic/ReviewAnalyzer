Spiceless dinner complete with dry meat and bland rice - Just because this resturant is slightly more expensive than the competing college budget resturants does not mean this resturant is better - obviously the other raters are confusing price with taste.In defense of Punjab Palace my water glass was kept full and the food came quickly - perhaps too quickly  - as the waiter seemed overeager to have us leave (although there were many empty tables and still others being served). --- Bottom line: Go somewhere else  if you want a decent Indian meal!
