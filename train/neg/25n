We were so excited to go to this restaurant after reading the reviews. The provolenta appetizer was delish. The bread was great. However the flank steak was not sub par. We ordered it with the fried eggs and both eggs were overcooked so the yolk was hard. The eggs were $3 in addition to the $24 steak. The waitress was nice but instead of deducting the price of the eggs or even a meal as good customer service she just got us a different topping so we paid full price for everything. The worst part was at the end of the meal the server stood over me while I selected the tip percentage. Awkward. I would go back but not anytime soon. The ambience is awesome (lighting feel) but the tables are on top of each other throughout the restaurant.
