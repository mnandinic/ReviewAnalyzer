I visited Pollo Campero for the second time in 6 years. Once I got there I was standing by the register thinking we had to order at the register. Then one of the workers there wearing red, in a very cold manner told us to sit down, that she's gonna take our order. Didn't even greet us nor gave us a warm welcome as we're not regular customers from there.

Then she tried taking our order but we weren't ready yet because we still didn't decide what we wanted to eat yet, she had kind of a "whatever then" body language and left elsewhere. After that, another employee DIANA who wore a BLACK shirt, different from the rest that were wearing red, took our order with such an attitude, very passive aggressive and poor body language. It was like every question we asked her seemed stupid to her and seemed like she was annoyed at taking our order and gave us attitude like we did something to her. The customer service lacked a lot. I was not happy

Never again do I plan to visit that restaurant, not after that experience. I felt a like I was treated like I was a stupid person and like I wasn't a worthy-enough customer to receive the proper friendliness and hospitality.
