"Hey, do you like sub par Mexican food at cheap ass Mexican prices?  Well, if you do then dis be  your place."

For Two dollars and a greasy nickel you can order half the menu, which I did.  But here is the catch, they don't send you what you ordered.  I hope Y'all like surprises because ordering from here is like opening up a box a cracker jacks.  "I DON'T KNOW WHATS IN HERE BUT I KNOW ITS A SURPRISE."   

They sent me two vegetable Quesadilla instead of one and forgot to send my vegetable burrito and taco salad. Okay, I can understand forgetting one thing.  I can understand accidentally sending something else by accident.  But forgetting two things?  That just ain't right. Do you know how many tricks I had to turn on craigslist to get that two dollars and a greasy nickel?  

I couldn't let this shit side.  I needs to get me my salad, cuz I'm a fake ass bitch. I called they ass up and was like where my food at!? They be all soundln' like a Cholo speak and spell.  I'm sorry, but I don't spic Spanish. 

Anyway, I got my food after a grueling 20 minutes.  When the salad got here it was looikin all cold and frozen like a lean cuisine.  I scrate through that in the garbage. The only reason I'm giving this ish two stars is because the 1st delivery driver looked kinda cute.  Call me boo, I know how to fold a burrito or two if you know what I'm saaaayin.
