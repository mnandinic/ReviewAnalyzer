Okay, I had big plans for my lunch from Maya Sol.  Like others here, I'm from SoCal and have been missing real Mexican food for years now.  I'd heard good things about Maya Sol and finally had an opportunity to give it a shot.

My friend ordered the chicken quesadilla, and I got the regular chicken burrito.  The quesadilla was okay, certainly nothing special (I make better ones at home).  There were random bits of vegetables (an odd piece of green bean and corn here and there) and just a few beans (do beans come with it or not?).  Overall, nothing to write home about.

The burrito was a hot mess.  It was overloaded with bland filler rice, and the "beans" were, again, just a smattering here and there--of kidney beans.  Kidney beans?  Plus the purported combination of cheese and sour cream combined with the rice to flavor the whole thing like some weird Mexican variant of ranch dressing.  The guac was pretty good, though, and the tortilla was nicely browned and crisp on one side.

I was prepared to fall in love with a new Mexican home-away-from-home, but...not so much.  Oh well.  Guess it's Anna's for me.
