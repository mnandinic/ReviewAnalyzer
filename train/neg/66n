I am not usually this critical of a restaurant, but let me say this place is by far the worst meal I have had since college.
Meals:
Steak with jalape?o stuffed something 
Chicken with vegetables (Girlfriend's food)
First thought:
Steak - way over cooked, sauce and some type of liquid all over everything and bland 
Chicken - way over cooked, different veggies all overcooked as well as being bland
Conclusion:
Steak - This was just awful, everything on the plate was so lack luster it was unbelievable. I don't know how this place has good reviews. When I read the reviews and saw all the photos I thought this place was going to be a gem but those reviews are either all friends or I picked a horrible day to go.
Chicken - Wasn't as bad as the steak the rice seemed like it was a few days old. All the food tasted the same bland and overcooked. I wouldn't go back unless they are closing the doors on the place and opening something worth going to. 

Side notes:
Hot sauce was really good
Take down the sign that says you won an award in 2002 it has been over 10 years no one is buying that.

Yelp review;
This is the second time in as many tries that yelp has given great reviews to a place and it has sucked. I am starting to question the validity of which these reviews are screened.
