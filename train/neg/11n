I went here this past weekend and I am saddened to say that I don't think I will be returning again. I hadn't been there in a while, but I believe that it has slowly started to decline. I was so excited to get the filet with the melted cheese they do on top, but I was extremely disappointed when I noticed they replaced the real cheese with a sauce that can be purchased readily- needless to say, it upset my stomach. For $30/plate this was definitely not worth it. 

I do have to say that the ambiance is nice as that the owner tries really hard to make it a 'fine-dining' experience even though it's just in the center of Arlington.. 1 star for that.
