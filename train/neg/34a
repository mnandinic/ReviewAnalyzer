Well... Puerto Rican food??? In theory... Yes. In taste? No. This is the only place in Boston that sell Puerto Rican food and the food is horrible. Cold tasteless and the service? I can get better service at KFC. I recommend this place as a last resource. I might be a little demanding but I am honest... You guys have no competition, you can do much better than that.
