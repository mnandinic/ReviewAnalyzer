    Went to tango for the first time today, was not impressed. The kids food came out ten min before the adults food, I had the churasco it was a good size but def not out of this world especially for the price, it was bland I had the choice of two sides I chose French fries and salad, the fries were cold. The service was horrible the waitress never asked how our food was, our checks had things that the other party ordered and when we asked her to fix it out took her twenty min to fix the check because she was too busy serving other guests.I must say that I will never return to tango from the reviews I was expecting something fabulous and sorry to say that I was very disappointed.
