This place just opened recently in my neighborhood, and a coupon and menu left at my house convinced me to come and and give it a try.  

Nothing special.  This is Salvadorean food on steam trays in a buffet line, dressed up to be called "Mexican".  It's definitely better than Taco Bell, but that's not saying much.  

I was excited to see what looked like a good green tomatillo salsa, you know the tasty kind with tomatillo, cilantro, and avocado.  After pouring some on my chips, it took one bit to realize that it was mostly a sickening puree of pickled jalapenos.  Can you imagine a salsa that taste like spicy pickles?  Eew.  It was really bad, I felt deceived by it's looks, and was really glad I didn't put it on my meal.

My burrito was mushy and not very flavorful.  The meat was bland, the beans and rice too squishy.  The one nice thing about it was that the bland flavors made the guacamole, which was actually pretty good, stand out.  

With several other (similarly medicore) Mexican places in the immediate vicinity, I can't help but wonder what the point is.  As for me, despite living very close by, I will continue to head out to Tacos Lupita or Taqueria a la Mexicana when I am in the mood for Mexican food.
