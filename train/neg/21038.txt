Mama's Place has literally been the worst place I've ever ordered from in my 26 years of living. I ordered through foodler.com and placed the order around 7:20pm. Almost TWO hours passed and, after 2 different phone calls where they ensured it would be there any minute, the food FINALLY arrived.....ICE COLD. It was absolutely ice cold. When I had called earlier, they had said to call back if we weren't satifsfied and they would refund us. I called the second it arrived and the phone was handed to the manager of Mama's. Let me assure you, this man was one of the rudest human beings I've ever talked to in my life. He DEMANDED that I give all of the cold food back to his driver in order for me to get refunded. But if I didn't give the COLD, LATE-ARRIVING food back, I could not get any sort of refund or compensation. Reminder, we waited 2 hours only to have cold food delivered to us. No matter how much I politely asked to have some sort of refund for the extreme inconvenience his restaurant caused me, I was not able to be refunded unless we returned the food which is absolutely, shockingly ridiculous and obscene from a customer service standpoint. He even went as far as to tell me to "make sure I have ALL of the order there to be picked up". That "nothing was eaten". My jaw dropped at the obscenely rude comments this manager was making to me, the customer. I will never order from this restaurant again and I insist that anyone who likes hot food delivered to them should NOT order from Mama's Place. I wish there was a way to rate a restaurant ZERO stars.Update: It is now 9:30pm and we are heating up this food in the oven in order to eat it...dinner time is long past and we are out $37. Needless to say, we are not happy and STRONGLY encourage no one to ever order from this terrible restaurant. They clearly don't value their customers.
