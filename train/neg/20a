I was very disappointed tonight by a delivery order with a burrito which was completely bland. No salsa, no jalopenos, no cilantro. Nothing. Just beans and rice and cheese food product of some type.

The mango 'milk shake' was worse. Big chucks of ice were in it and it tasted bad.

I threw them both away half eaten and now I feel sick at my stomach.

On the plus side they agreed to refund my money. If they actually do that I will change this to two stars just to recognize that they did one thing right.
