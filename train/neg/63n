this review is based of the one and only time i visited yelys. yely i assume is someone who works here. this is a cantina/cafeteria type of eatery. i had the rice and beans (surprise surprise) with fried pork. the rice and beans tasted bland and the pork had probably been sitting there for a long while. it was lukewarm and hard. no gracias.
