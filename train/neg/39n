Myself and 4 of my friends came here for the first time for New Years eve dinner. It was a pre-fixed menu of a filet, sirloin with lobster tail and a tuna dish. We all opted for the filet or the sirloin with lobster tail. Unfortunately, we were all disappointed. Neither meat dish was cooked properly and the lobster that came with the sirloin was just a half of a lobster tail and was hands down, the worst I've ever had. Poor in taste and in preparation.

The meal was $65 per person, (not including tax & gratuity.) Included was an bland appetizer, a disappointing entree, a fossilized dessert, and a glass of very cheap, extra dry champagne. 

The only way this place could have redeemed itself was with a cultural atmosphere and ambiance which it entirely lacked considering it was new years eve. 

Oh and where was our "surprises?"
