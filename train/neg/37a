I've come a few times already and it's been very inconsistent. 

The food has been cold and either too salty or taste like it's been out all day. I do understand this is a cafeteria style but if the food will be sitting out they should change it often. 

The big thing that really irritated me was the pricing. A few times they've charged me differently on plates that I've ordered before. They don't have a set price on drinks and I paid different prices on separate occasions.
