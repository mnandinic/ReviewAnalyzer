The service was sooo bad, that I won't be back. I went here twice and liked my meal, although I found the menu pretty simple, I really enjoyed the "experience" that this place offered--- the iced drink on dry ice,  and the end of meal cotton candy. But the last time I went I was completely bummed.- no dry ice drink, no cotton candy, painfully long wait for the food, drinks, and then finally the check. The bar was packed with an unsavory crowd, and the place was loud. Sorry, when you guys lost the dry ice and cotton candy and service-- you lost me!
