Let me preference this review by stating I like this type of food.

With that said, I am not a fan of Tostado.

I ordered the "Tostado Club" (Chicken, Pork, Ham, Cheese, Tomato, Ketchup, May, Onion) and didn't think it was that good.

The restaurant itself is dark and dreary, a machine was running in the background which was deafening, and I didn't find the staff all that friendly.
