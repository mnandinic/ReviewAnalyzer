I honestly don't know where the good reviews are coming from, I've eaten in so many spsnish restaurants and the food quality of this restaurant completely failed. As previous reviews, salsa has no flavor, nachos tasted like if they were a year old, rice no flavor, sopa de camarones (shrimp soup) tasted like if they just added water to left overs and the price for the food is way expensive. Go to mi tierra restaurant or margaritas.
