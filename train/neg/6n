For a place with a great atmosphere and great location the food is extremely disappointing...
Our food came out in less than 5 minutes (I had ordered lasagna and my friend had ordered stuffed-baked peppers) and the food was burning hot. The first thing that came to mind was ... Microwaved. The taste was pretty bland, no exceptional component. 

The service was not memorable.

The one star is for the tangy sauce they serve with the bread.

Will not be going back.
