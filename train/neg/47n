One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. 

Got a Groupon Coupon and was SO excited to try out this local spot! Cold bread, greasy bottle of off-tasting dipping oil. My friend ordered Beef Ribs -- bland, sinewy, no flavor; he ate a few bites and left the majority of his portion, untouched.

I ordered lamb chops medium rare - they came out well done (literally, the faintest of pink in one of three chops - the other two had no pink meat, at all) and, when I asked for a replacement, the OWNER came to our table to tell me that "this is how medium rare meat is cooked" ... he angrily argued AT me, until I suggested we had a different understanding of how to cook meat.

I cancelled my order and was charged full price for the rest of the meal. Our poor waiter was profusely apologetic and (said) he had asked the owner not to come over to us, as he also agreed the meat was overcooked.

I STRONGLY suggest skipping Tango, unless you're up for bland food and an angry restaurant owner.
