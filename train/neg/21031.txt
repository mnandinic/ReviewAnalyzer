Worst delivery service in Boston. They only restaurant in Brookline with a delivery service that won't deliver to ANY address in Brighton, no matter how close!I live two seconds from Whole Foods on Washington st in Brighton, What is an hour long walk down Washington St through Brookline Village to Huntington st, down to Mama's Place for me is normally a 5-10 minute drive down virtually one road for a delivery guy. Because my address is in Brighton and not Brookline (Regardless of living on the virtual boundary, 2.2 miles away from the restaurant) I get a call an hour after placing my order online from a woman named Tina telling me they don't deliver "that far"...Thanks for nothing Mama. Revise your automatic delivery refusals!
