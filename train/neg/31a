Worst Spanish food ever. The plates are dirty and the food is greasy. Stay away from this restaurant at all cost, they are rude and very unprofessional , when I asked for the manager they refused to come out of the kitchen, and  as I looked he was picking his nose, later they informed me that he was the  Ramiro the owner, after what I saw there was no need to talk to no manager. Really disgusting... never going back that place.
