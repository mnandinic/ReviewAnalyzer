So over this place. I always feel so rushed and the guy that usually serves the food doesn't listen to what I say (I speak fluent Spanish, too). They also are inconsistent with portions and make up their prices as they go. 

Also, some of the food is mediocre. The potato salad is super cold and drenched in mayo (I just tossed it in the trash) and I hate when they automatically put beans on your rice. Every single latin restaurant I have been to in the past puts beans in a separate container so I find this very odd. All set for sure.
