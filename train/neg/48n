This was our third time dining at Tango (the last times were 2 and 3 years ago, when I would probably have rated it 3 or even 4 stars).

We arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation at 5:30.  The restaurant was nearly empty yet it took about 10 minutes to get seated.  The 2 different hostesses who helped us were both unfriendly (one was bordering on rude).

The good:
--Our waiter.  Friendly and polite.
--The mixed vegetables - crunchy and tasty.
--The bread.  

The mediocre:
--The pure porteno 
--The taste of one of the steaks

The bad:
--The aforementioned hostesses
--We were charged for a steak special but served a regular (similar) steak.  We had been waiting so long for everything that it wasn't worth the $2 to bother to change it since we were anxious to just leave and go across the street for ice cream
--The steak - it wouldn't be bad if it cost $15 or $20, but for $30 it should have been a lot better (and one of the steaks was tough and flavorless)
--The mashed potatoes:  Cold (and even when the leftovers were reheated the next day the taste was bland)
--Slow to be seated, slow for the food to be served (our steaks were medium rare after all, shouldn't take forever
--Overpriced.  Everything is overpriced.

3rd time was not the charm.  And we won't be back.  And to top it off, we received an email the following day that we had not honored our OpenTable reservation and therefore would not received our dining points.  I replied back but never got a resolution.
