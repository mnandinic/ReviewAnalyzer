Came here by accident while looking for another restaurant. Got the combo sandwich - meat was cooked perfectly but lacked any real flavor. Cheese was square and bland, appeared to be a Kraft single or something of the ilk, definitely not what you'd expect. The hot sauce is the kicker - flavorful, packs a MEAN punch that lingers; without it, the sandwich might as well be a CVS wrap.
