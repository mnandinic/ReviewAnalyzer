WOW. in the past year this place has gone DOWNHILL!!! Prices on the menu are never what they charge. 
Food is horrible now. They sent me a piece of chicken that was all shredded. A SOUR MOLDY piece of cheese. HORRIBLE!  After calling and talking to the owner I understand why this place has gone downhill. He was so RUDE & WAS NOT sorry at all.
