Went for a 2nd time after a recent doc appt in the area.  First time I went was when there was a line around the building with police detail.  The chicken was fantastic the first time.

The 2nd time was a disappointment.  The employees are rude and won't look you and talk to each other in spanish while taking your order.  I ordered a 12pc mix of fried chicken and was told there was no breast and if I wanted all dark.  I asked how long would the wait be for white meat and didn't get an answer.  Another employee got me 3 pieces of breast right on the rack.  Then I'm told there's no more wings and all the darks would be legs and thighs.  Another customer wants to order chicken strips and was told no more.  This is 1:30pm in the afternoon!!!  Not sure if they weren't going to cook more until the dinner rush...

The chicken in the box was obviously cooked a couple hours ago.  No longer juicy and just dried out.  The beans however was really good.  Rice was overcooked.  My son said the fries was fresh and good.
