This is far and away the WORST delivery experience I have ever had.  Ever.  And I have had some super crappy delivery.  If I could give them zero stars or negative stars, I would do it.  With pleasure.

I placed an order online at 7:30 pm this evening.  It gave me a funny message after I placed it, so I called the restaurant directly to confirm my order.  The order was wrong, despite the fact that I still had the confirmation screen up.  And it's not like I ordered something complicated--freaking nachos and a quesadilla.  That was the first problem.

Fast forward an hour later.  The food still hasn't shown up.  I call the woman--who was very nice--and she says the delivery guy should be here very soon.  A half hour later he still has not shown up.  I call again.  They tell me they have delivered the food.  Well, considering I had never left my apartment, and I am not deaf, they hadn't.  They then determine that my address is in the system wrong.  Way to go with the online ordering system--because again, I have the page up.  I double check the address with them--spelling it out even though I live on a numbered street.

She then tells me that someone will be over immediately, with the food and with my money back.  

An HOUR later, nothing has arrived.  It's 10 pm.  I call again.  They tell me the delivery guy has been calling me.  Well, clearly he hasn't because I was sitting with my effing phone in the hallway outside of my apt because I finally had to put my kid to bed, and the door noise would wake her up.  And I did have a signal, FYI.  I have no missed calls and no voicemails.

I basically hung up on them, and I plan on sending a nasty letter to the manager.  This place is teh suck.  BIG TIME.  

And I'm still hungry.  Angry and hungry.  Bastards.
