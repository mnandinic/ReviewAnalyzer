Promising but missing the mark. Bustling vibe on a Saturday night. For $25 an entree, one expects more than fishy smelling swordfish and an over cooked 1/2 inch steak. How hard is it to cook it medium rare?  Table cloths would have helped. Plus side: Mushroom appetizer was tasty and loaded with cheese and sides of rice and squash were solid.  But... Don't cry for me Argentina....
