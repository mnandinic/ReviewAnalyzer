Garbage. I don't get it.Horrible sandwiches.I've seen the lines - been here twice just to give them a second chance.Their signature sandwich has no flavor. It's an overcooked piece of meat with green beans on it. The beef is dry and chewy. The chicken is dry and flavorless.This place is a joke. You are all zombies!!!!
