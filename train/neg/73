This place is overpriced and the staff is obnoxious. We were told an hour wait for a table, fine whatever. While ordering drinks at the bar, there are about 5 open tables that I can see. And hour and a half later, we complain to the manager that we have now spent over $100 at the bar and would like a table so we can eat. He then sits us at one of the 5 open tables. When we go to order food and drinks, they tell us that we are cut off. Seriously? After a few cocktails while waiting at the bar for and hour and a half, you think we are too drunk? We are all adults and if we were rightfully cut off I wouldn't be complaining, but this was absurd.

If you enjoy being jerked around by condescending staff, then come to this place. I never will again.
