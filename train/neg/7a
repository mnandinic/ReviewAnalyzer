Absolutely terrible. DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY. I waited 1.5hrs for them to deliver a burrito. I kept calling them asking when the food would arrive and it was always "in 5 minutes." The food got here cold. I was so mad I refused to tip the driver which I never do. The burrito was average at best. The empanada was the worst I had tasted. I will never ever ever order fro here again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
