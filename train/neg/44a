Let me start off by saying, I was so excited for this place to open in the north end. As a local resident, anything other than Italian food is welcome. I love what they did with the space, there's a handful tables to sit down. I got the choriqueso torta. The flavors were pretty good but there was just too much mayo and the dish was overall very unhealthy. Maybe I caught it on an off day but the bun was just soaking in grease. Probably perfect to eat after a hangover but not when you're sober and eating this for dinner. Prices are good but I just can't endorse.
