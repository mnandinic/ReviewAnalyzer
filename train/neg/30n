Disclaimer: This review is for a New Years Eve dining experience and does not reflect our general impression of the restaurant over the past several years. Before this experience, this was one of my favorite steak places.

My husband and I have been going to Tango a couple times a year for the past three years. I have always loved the steak and the amazing flavors. Since we hadn't been in a while, we decided to try it for New Years Eve. After reading another review from earlier in 2013, I see that it's not just me that noted the "efficiency improvements" that don't appear to be improving much. I used to love the interaction with the wait staff. Our server was very nice on NYE, but our orders got a little confused through the tablet ordering system. One person's veggies were on another person's plate, etc. The biggest disappointment was the quality of the chicken. We were there with some friends and since one of our friends had recently had steak, he ordered chicken. He truly couldn't eat it. It was very rubber-like and the sauce on top was reminiscent of a manufactured cheese sauce. The server was very apologetic and they took the meal off the bill and offered us each another glass of wine, but it was just disappointing, since I've never been disappointed by Tango before. To be fair, my fillet was good and the chocolate mousse cake was very tasty.

As we walked out of the restaurant, we saw several plates of chicken in the kitchen waiting to be served. We speculated that they just prepared too much in anticipation of a NYE rush that never showed up while we were there, but it's not a way to impress customers who are out celebrating. I hope that the tablet ordering goes away and the attention to quality food preparation returns; but I know that we won't return for NYE.
