Oh we had such high hopes. Normally I wouldn't take the time to write a review for any place less than 4 stars but I feel compelled to say do not waste your time or money here. Service was clueless, apathetic and slow.  Chips and salsas were good and a nice touch being gratis.  Drinks are overpriced, over sweetened and watered down.  Nachos were unimpressive and the "addition" of short ribs was 2 small pieces we nearly missed.  Guacamole trio was under seasoned and boring.

Why they bring free cotton candy at the end of the meal is beyond any reason.  Maybe they want to capture a really young 20s clientele who haven't been out to many great restaurants yet and will look past all the shortcomings because of the free start and finish to the meal as that seemed to be 90% of the clientele there.
