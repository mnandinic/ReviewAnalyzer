So I just walked in to Mi Tierra. And the place is busy. There are 2 people working the front and diner area. I wait in line until it's my turn to order take out. The lady at the front immediately grabs all the money in the tip cup as if it hadn't sat there all day. In wich I took offensive. But I didn't say anything. I ordered a burrito. $6.95 and the lady tells me it's a $10.00 minimum. Mind you there is no sign. Now I politely tell her that I have an issue. She said we are busy. If you don't like it you can go. Get out! If I didn't have any sense I would of went off in there. Instead I took my money and walked out. First time I have ever been discriminated against at a Mexican restaurant. This place is a joke.
