Ordered from Foodler and it took almost two hours to be delivered, even though the original estimate was 60 mins. When it finally arrived it was ice cold. Owner was extremely unapologetic and, frankly, quite rude and abrasive. He refused to refund us until we returned all of the food. So at this point we have been hungry for two hours, are out $30 and have nothing to eat. Worst experience with a food delivery and I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. EVER.
