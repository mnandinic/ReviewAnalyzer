I really do not like this place. It doesn't take much to impress me with this kind of cuisine but something about their food is just off. The burritos are always soggy and after ordering a burrito without beans I ended up having to pick them all out myself. The rest of the service was also really slow.
Their chips are really subpar. It's a shame that the hellhole that is Margarita's has better chips. My date ordered a beef dish and the waitress brought out two enormous plates of food! I couldn't believe the size of the portions. I don't mind getting huge amounts of food because it just means I get to eat well for two to three meals instead of one, but if it's shitty food it just means more garbage to deal with.
Yummy pina coladas though. Best I've ever had.
