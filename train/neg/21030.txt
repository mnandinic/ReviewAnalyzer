Mama's Place was absolutely the worst delivery service I've ever had.So, I come home from a long plane ride and rush hour trip on the T with my suitcase. Needless to say, I was feeling lazy and was in no mood to go grocery shopping or to cook. I tell you this, because I definitely should have fought with the Mama's staff more than I did, but I was just too tired.I ordered food on Foodler. I ordered a California Chicken Salad, Mac and Cheese bites, and a Raspberry Lime Ricky. Foodler told me they'd be there in about half an hour- good enough. Twenty minutes later I get a phone call about my salad. They didn't have avocado and offered to replace it with mushrooms. Avocado is the main reason I chose that salad, but oh well, things happen. (Though, for sake of argument, Stop and Shop is a 3 minute walk from Mama's, so they could easily have gotten more). I told her to replace it with green peppers instead. Then, an hour later, my food still hadn't arrived at my house. I called the restaurant to find out that the person had just left and should arrive in 10 minutes (with no apology). So, the food arrives and I open it and find my salad, the soda, and no mac and cheese bites. Call the restaurant again and tell them what happened. He says, "hold on a second" and hangs up on me. I wait eight minutes to see if he intended on calling me back- he didn't. So I call again and say, "we must have been disconnected..." and he tells me that they're making the mac and cheese bites then. Thanks for telling me? Again, no apology. So, forty minutes later my mac and cheese bites finally arrive with one extra $2 soda (was this their apology?)As for the food? Not great. The chicken on the salad was much too salty. The mac and cheese bites were meh. And the lime ricky basically just tasted like Polar Raspberry Lime soda (which, admittedly, is delicious, but not the house made lime ricky I was hoping for).Don't know why this place has 4 stars! Terrible disappointment.
