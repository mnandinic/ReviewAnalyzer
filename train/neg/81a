This place just let me down for a second time.

First time I came it was alright but not great.  The tacos I had were good but they didn't taste like the chorizo tacos I was used to eating/ordering back home at several different places.

The set-up by the waterfront is great and that gives it a lot of points in my book but after my last visit I even hesitate to visit this place again no matter how many people are raving and saying how great it is.

This time my party of 3 waited for 2 hours and didn't even get our food order taken so we eventually walked out.

It wasn't that Lola's was busy, they just didn't really seem to be serving anything that wasn't drinks or chips with blah salsa.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that the hard-working bartender was babysitting everyone in the place until the patrons could get hungry enough to get bored and go somewhere else to eat.

I almost started to wonder if maybe they just didn't have any cooks/chefs all of a sudden?

Which.. Okay. Fine.  If that's the case: TELL EVERYONE SO THAT THEY CAN LEAVE.

It was a mess.  

No excuse.

I don't think I've ever been in a situation like this that didn't at least involve the place being packed or busy.
