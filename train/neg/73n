I love the chicken here. But these girls at the counter are on a mission in charging me muchos dinero..... Every time I come here they try to upgrade my order (without my permission) up-selling their sides, I mean I understand every fast food restaurant does this but here it isn't very transparent and more deceitful. These guys aren't all that good with communication (which I can understand) but the rest has no excuses. 

Once again Food and Service are Great and they deserve a 5 Star but unfortunately I had to give 1Star from my past experiences.
