My friend went to Yely's & ordered Pork with spaghetti this evening. He went to take his first or second bite and found a ROACH in his food! 
We went back and showed the employees what we found. There was a language barrier; however, that's no excuse to have a careless attitude. So unprofessional. They offered us $10.00 but that doesn't dismiss the fact that there was a roach in the food. They did nothing. Appalled and beyond disgusted! 
BEWARE!
