Never going back here again. 

Bartenders were very rude and didn't even know how to make their own drinks on their own menu. Definitely avoid the female bartender with lots of tattoos and dark hair. My boyfriend ordered a drink from the menu that came with Bacardi and instead she poured a cheaper rum. When he asked her if they had Bacardi as was listed on the menu, she argued about which rum was better and refused to make the drink as it was listed on the menu. The manager apologized as they did in fact have Bacardi, but still did not offer to correct the drink. 

Very unprofessional for what I thought could have otherwise been a decent bar.
