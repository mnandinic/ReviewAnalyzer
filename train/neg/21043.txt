First off, Food. -4 stars-The food is very good for the low prices they have. I've ordered from there twice now, getting a burger each time and they are delicious. You get a lot of food for your buck. You always get tons of fries, onion rings, or whatever side you order.Second, the service. -0 stars-I ordered delivery both times. The first time was good, food came on time, paid and went on with my day. The second time they called me to come downstairs of my apartment building to get my food. So, I put on my shoes, grab my keys, not moving slowly at all. I started walking downstairs and I get another call to hurry up, because he couldn't find a parking spot. Being up 2 floors, I guess takes too long. If I was old and had to walk down stairs slowly, I would probably had spit in my food from the delivery man. So I go down, open the door and get my food and then the delivery man decides to yell at me to come down when he calls... which I did. Apparently he was in a big hurry. He went on saying he's going to get a ticket, and what not. All in a very angry manner. I didn't tell him this, but he has 15 minutes where he was parked. I gave him a good tip, which I had already dug out of my wallet on the way down. I honestly believe he deserved $0 in a tip, and I'm a strong believer in tipping. Never had a delivery driver yell at me the way he did.
