I enjoyed the dim lights but the ceilings are kind of low and the db per capita is quite high. I didn't feel comfortable in there at all. The bar is surrounded by a metal railing of some kind which made getting up to the bar quite difficult seeing how the area inside the railing was loaded to the gills with db's. When I was able to get up to the bar I was pleasantly surprised to be waited on rather quickly. Apparently Jesus went to bartending school after rising from the dead because he waited on me.  Luckily I didn't get one of his beard hairs in my drink.  The joy of being waitied on so fast quickly deminished when I was informed that my one beer and my gf's drink came to $19.00..... $19.00??? for a beer and a drink are you kidding me? I won't be back to this over priced db factory
