This is the worst Mexican food I have had in this area. It seemed that everything was microwaved. The rice probably came from a freezer bag, and the beans were straight out of a can with no seasoning. I ordered cheese enchiladas, and they were tiny. One of them didn't even have cheese inside! And they had a tiny bit of crushed tomato rubbed on top, definitely not the sauce you expect when ordering enchiladas. The salad was very sub par, and they only gave us one packet of dressing for two salads. I definitely suggest that you not order from this restaurant!
