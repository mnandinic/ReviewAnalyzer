The one and only star is for Marlon, our server, who was phenomenal and friendly and funny and patient throughout an otherwise dismal experience. 

My husband and I had been looking forward to coming here forever, and unfortunately will never return. Thank goblins we had a Groupon. 

First, the appetizer was great. Dates wrapped in bacon; yum. Our drinks and app came out quickly and Marlon was attentive and fast. However, we feel as if they "got" two additional drinks out of us because we had to do *something* while we waited an hour for our food. An. Hour. Good thing we weren't hungry or anything.

When our food came out, it was severely undercooked. So much so that our waiter noticed and comped part of the bill. We really aren't ones to complain, so that was a nice touch. What wasn't a nice touch was having the manager come over to apologize and tell us that "here, either the service is bad or the kitchen is. Tonight, it was the kitchen!" Maybe she was trying to be funny, but what she did was tell us that we are right to never return, as it will always be a gamble. How unprofessional of her! 
The steaks were also very bland. Mine should have been grilled in the chimichurri sauce but I'm sure it was grilled plain. 

The atmosphere tries to be romantic and nice, but it is as loud as a sports bar. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for, but I was expecting a nice date night with my husband. 

Again, I'm glad we had the Groupon and only had to spend money on our server's gratuity (which he definitely earned with the slow kitchen and bad food).
