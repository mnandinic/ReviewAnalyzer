Just had the worst experience placing an order for delivery. Waited almost 2 hours for delivery,  called twice, was ensured that the food would be delivered in the next 10 min each time. When the food finally arrived, everything was ice old. We called to see what our options were.  Apparently, the only option was to return all of the food (making sure everything was there as quoted by the owner of the restaurant) and then we could wait another 45 minutes for a redelivery once the order was "checked out" at the restaurant. I spoke to the owner myself and I have never felt so deceived and disrespected as a customer. When you place an order for delivery, you expect the food to arrive still warm and fresh, not the same temperature as something out of the fridge. I can accept that it was a busy night and it was a mistake but the owner of the restaurant was completely unwilling to see the situation from the customers point of view. Needless to say, I will never order from this restaurant again. And I would highly recommend that if you expect your food hot at delivery, do not order here. Worst experience ever.
