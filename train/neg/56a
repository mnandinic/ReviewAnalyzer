I will never return to Lolita.  The management was terrible.  Unfortunately, this was my first time there and while the waitress was wonderful, the manager spoiled the entire dining experience.  

Upon my first five minutes within the establishment, the manager, Anthony, proceeded to insult my entire party with his condescending, argumentative, and confrontational tone.  Looking back now, we should have left right away after enduring such harsh treatment, but instead, we proceeded to eat and drink and ended up spending over $200 on one round of drinks and appetizers (food was completely overpriced).

When Anthony was approached later to see if there was someone else that we could speak with about his horrible treatment of his customers, he proceeded to become wildly defensive and confrontational again saying things like, "Whatever lady!  I'm sorry you feel this way.  You can give me whatever yelp review you want.  I don't care!"  He was raising his voice and other customers were watching the entire ordeal.  

I'm not sure if the owner of Lolita is aware of how terrible their manager, Anthony, is, but if they want anyone to ever return, they need to teach him how to treat people.  I've never been so insulted in my life by a fancy restaurant establishment.  Given the prices, location, and atmosphere, this behavior was completely appalling and unacceptable.
