This place flat-out sucks! After waiting for over an hour for medium-rare lamb chops, we were served RAW lamb chops.  They were not just undercooked or "not to our liking".  They were fleshy and raw on the inside! I was beside myself that we had waited over an hour for dishes that couldn't have taken even the most amateur short-order cook 3 minutes to "prepare".  This food was as careless as it was inedible (think toxoplasmosis).  They're really lucky someone from the health department wasn't served our food.  They seemed to think they were doing us a favor by not charging us but we were already on our way out and had no intention of paying for this disastrous evening.  In the words of Gordon Ramsey "SHUT IT DOWN!".
