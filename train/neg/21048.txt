I really had an Indian food craving tonight, after a rainy day.I ordered the vegetable samosas, the lamb curry and the mango lassi for delivery.Here are all the things that killed it for me:1- the food arrived cold. I like my food at least warm, especially when it involves something fried and covered in sauce...2- the samosas were soggy from the water vapor condensed in the plastic container. Also, I did not like the sauces that came with the samosas (one tasted like ketchup with vinegar, and the other was tomato paste with raw onions). Where are the chutneys and/or the yogurt sauces? :(3- the lamb curry was sooo bland. It really had no density or kick to it.The lassi was good. I know it is supposed to be super sweet traditionally so I will not complain.Overall REALLY disappointed. I am not a picky eater but you expect something better for a $25 meal....I don't understand how people have given this place good ratings. Not worth it, I promise. It feels nice to vent
