As other reviews have stated, this place DISCRIMINATES.  They wasted 2 hours of our night and refused to serve us because we had California IDs.

My friends and I were on our law school spring break, visiting from Los Angeles. We went to Lolita with a bunch of our friends who were BU dental school students on a Tuesday night to grab some drinks. We were all over 25 years old. 

The cocktail waitress carded us, and was over analyzing our California IDs. After showing her where the date of birth was located and telling her that I'm a married 27 year old, she went on to ID the rest of the group. There were 4 CA IDs, as well as some MA and others. 20 minutes after taking our orders, the bartender asked us for our IDs again, and asked for secondary form of ID. We all showed them 2-3 credit cards. 

45 minutes later, the cocktail waitress came around and said that they would not be able to serve us because of our IDs and that they were asking us to leave. We were furious. This place was discriminating against our out of state IDs. Instead of wasting our time making us wait 1.5 hour for dumb margaritas, they could've at least refused us earlier. 

The "manager" was rude, ignorant, and had no grounds to refuse us. We have made sure to tell all BU students to avoid this place. Horrible service, rude people, and they discriminate. AVOID.
