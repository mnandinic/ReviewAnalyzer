eh, not so much.  first, GET THE SMALL.  very important tip for you first-timers!  second, dont plan on sitting...PACKED!  third, come with cash only.  there are signs all over the doors, but just be prepared...dont be that guy.i ordered the BBQ chicken and it was just below mediocre.  the bread was great and the veggies were good(yes even the green beans) but the chicken was D-R-Y-dry.  overall, i'm thankful i ordered the BBQ.  that added some flavor to this pretty bland sammie.  plus i splurged and bought one of their $2 cans of soda to wash this Sahara desert down.  Probably will choose Subway next time.
