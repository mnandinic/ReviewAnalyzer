I just really disliked this place as soon as I walked in and couldn't see where the hell I was going.  It's pitch black and there are pointy wrought iron fence-tops and candles with live flames everywhere, not to mention the stairs down into the bar and seating areas.

I saw someone order tacos, which came out on a soup platter.  There was a lump of meat and cheese in the middle and exactly 6 tortilla chips stuck into it.  They did provide additional tortilla chips upon request, though.  I don't know if they were charged for that.  So listen, I don't know what that dish would be classified as, but its not "tacos".

I couldn't see, and I felt like there was danger on all sides, so I couldn't even bring myself to order a drink and make the commitment to be there that long.  The last straw was when I went to the restroom (thankfully well lit), had to wedge myself through Western saloon-style doors to get into/out of the stall, and almost ran into a burning stick of incense on my way out.  It was sticking out of the wall at eye level as I came around a corner and freaked me the hell out.  Finally, I want to mention that the cheap, scratchy washcloths they provide to dry your hands in the restroom looked pretty dingy.
