A little disappointed with this place & to write this review, this became the special go to place a few years back for my family, bomb food, & nice portions! For years It was my mothers favorite place before she passed in 2011, so after she died i would come down every so often to get a great plate & keep her memory alive. But now i feel like they just serve food to keep the money flowing & that they no longer cook to please the customers, just another day. i got a plate today, the rice is good but really doesn't seems prepared like they care, the chopped chicken is cooked but the skin isnt crunchy at all,  but moist & soft & a little slimy because of that. Just not like how it used to be, another one bites the dust. Smh.

S/n: someone on here said they had found a roach in thier plate so it is CONFIRMED that I will not be finishing my plate from earlier or coming back! I don't want Any Surprises! Thanks but no thanks!
