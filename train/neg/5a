I just ordered from this place and what a waste it was. I ordered a Chicken Special Burrito with mild sauce, beans, sour cream, cheese, pico de Gallo and yellow rice- for all those waste ingredients I ordered it was the driest burrito I have ever had. My partner ordered a quesadilla that did not even come with cheese in it, it was like a big flat taco. Save your money don't order from here.
