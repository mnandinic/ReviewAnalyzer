I tried to order delivery from them. I don't know about their food because I haven't eaten yet, as I am currently warming up my meal which took over 1 hour and 40 minutes to arrive . It is completely unacceptable for delivery to take this long. 

I had decided to try their banana milkshake because I love banana, and so it was of course completely melted and not edible. Then when I tried to call to at least get my money back on that, they screened my call (I had called earlier to find my food so they had my number) and didn't answer. Also their mailbox was full, probably of other complaints. 

I will not order from them again.
