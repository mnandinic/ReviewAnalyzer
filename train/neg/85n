not recommended.  went here with a friend last night.  place was empty.  there was no mirror or paper towels in the mens room.  we were brough bottles of poland spring water when we asked for water.

the food was mediocre at best.  our server was very nice, and it looked like they had some nice tequilas, but this place took bad boston area mexican food to a whole nother level.
