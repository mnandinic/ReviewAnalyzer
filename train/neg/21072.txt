The row of restaurants near/on Northeastern's campus is really a crapshoot. Some of them are delicious, and the students reward them with husky dollars galore. However, most are mediocre to bad, and we (sadly) shower them with our money regardless- mostly because they're convenient.Boston Shawarma has sort of a weird odor to it, which (I know) doesn't always mean bad food. But I've had good shawarma and falaffel, and this does not measure up at all. If you really want Middle Eastern food, Jaffa is not that far away and not that much more expensive. If you really want food that's nearby, Temptations Caf√© next door has halfway decent falaffel. Save your money, or at least go somewhere else.
