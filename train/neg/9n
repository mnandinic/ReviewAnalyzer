Second time here and unfortunately the chefs may be different. Ordered the Argentinian parrilla and the steak ordered medium well came out burnt. The chicken was just the breast and too dry. Wanted to complain but didn't want to raise an issue because of the business associates i was with. Not worth the money. The sides were embarrassingly small. The only thing good was the flan. Ive been to several steak places and this was not good for the price.
If you are not happy, return it. You shouldn't pay these prices for what they offer.
