Delivery took over an hour and a half and was definitely not worth the wait.  I got the AdoBADa Pork Burrito which was so mushy you couldn't distinguish the ingredients and so salty that I could only stomach eating half of it, if it did have the hot sauce I asked for in it, it definitely would be the mildest hot sauce ever.  

The melon drink wasn't bad, some kind of honeydew flavored concoction.  It was disappointing because I had wrongly assumed it would be a watermelon aqua fresca and also because it was placed sideways on top of my food in a plastic cup and naturally spilled everywhere and was slightly warm when it arrived.

The strangest item was the chicken tamale.  It was very greasy, did not come wrapped and was about three times the size of any tamale I've ever seen.  Tamales are usually steamed, so I am not sure where all the grease came from, but it was gross.  Also, it was filled with random vegetables - various peppers and squash - and only had minuscule pieces of chicken.

Overall a very poor experience, bad delivery, bad food, bad customer service.
