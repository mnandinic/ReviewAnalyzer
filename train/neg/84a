We went on a Friday night around 8:30pm and were greeted by a congested and dark foyer and a 2 hour wait. OK, understandable. We put our name in and head to a nearby bar for cocktails. We return 1.5 hours later, grab a Lolita margarita ($12) and linger in the bar area for our table. Meanwhile, I head to the restroom. The stall doors were like saloon doors; interesting but a bit difficult to get through with a purse and down coat plus the confined space. Once through the door, there was no purse hook (note: this is a personal pet peeve). I delicately hung my purse on the door hinge and threw my coat over the top. The toilet, while interesting, was reminiscent of an Ed Hardy shirt. I go to wash my hands and instead of paper towels, they have hand towels. This was a nice little perk. However, the whole bathroom experience came off like they were trying too hard.

Back out to the bar I find my friends and we were seated soon thereafter. The service was fine - nothing amazing but nothing terrible. The dip trio was tasty and my friends were swooning over the mango-habanero salsa. My biggest issue lies with my entree. I ordered the the mahi mahi tacos for $15. The plate comes out and it's three mini tortillas, a strip of mahi that looked like it could have been used from a box of Gordon's Fisherman frozen fish sticks, maybe four shreds of cabbage and some chipotle mayo salsa. $15!?!?! $15. No beans and rice or any other sides...those have to be ordered separately and cost about $6 each. Maybe it's because I'm from California and I'm used to big portions at Mexican restaurants for a reasonable price, but this was ridiculous. The cotton candy that came after was only mildly redeeming.

The food was mediocre and WAY overpriced, the drinks were good, but again overpriced. Essentially you're paying for the ambience. If I go back, it'll be for the drinks and bar scene, but certainly not the food.
