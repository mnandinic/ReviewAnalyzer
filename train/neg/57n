It's unfortunate to write this. I read all the other reviews and had high hopes. But from drinks, appetizers, main course, to dessert was unappealing, bland, undercooked. I have been to Peru and several Peruvian restaurants around the country. This is the worst. Don't listen to the hype of food rating channel. I decided to give this place a try after seeing it on Phantom Gourmet.  This is one of the several places that was "peddled" by PG that was awful.
