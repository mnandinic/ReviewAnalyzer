Sticky spare ribs: BBQ'd pork ribs with a spicy Mexican coffee bean, chocolate, sesame and orange glaze. Ribs had way too much sauce. Think like tar. Couldn't eat more than one and didn't even like the one. Blech.These were clearly a disappointment.

Rib-eye tacos: sliced grilled rib-eye, tobacco onions, garlic crema. I ate more of these tacos than anything else. They were a little dry on their own but drenched in the garlic crema they were delicious. That being said, not sure if having to drench something in sauce to make it delicious is the best review I've ever given.

Crispy masa oysters: lghtly fried east coast oysters dusted with red chile masa and chipotle crema. These oysters had way too much breading on them, you could barely taste the oysters.

Mahi mahi flautas: roasted corn, poblano and chipotle chiles, jack cheese and avocado-tomatillo salsa. Fluatas good but a little soggy. These were halfway decent but they were soggy, as I mentioned. We thought maybe it was because everything came out at once which made things sit a bit longer then they should have and get cold. Bummer as they could have been good otherwise.

Overall, the food was not impressive. It wasn't even mediocre. I wouldn't go back for dinner although I can say that the drinks were great so I would go back for that. The atmosphere was lively but not rowdy and a bit of a younger crowd.
