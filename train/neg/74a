DO NOT GO HERE. 

First of all, this place is way overrated, if you don't have a reservation, its a 2 hour wait, you can find much better places to go in the area, not worth it.  The bartender was absolutely terrible, she had the worst attitude, and flat out ignored my friends and I because she was too busy flirting.   If you are looking for a really loud, over priced, over crowded, and pretentious place to go, this is the place to be.  Just keep in mind the staff will treat you terribly, as it is an opportunity for them to chase out people and make room for others.   My friends and I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant in the area, that was only a 10 min walk and had amazing service.
