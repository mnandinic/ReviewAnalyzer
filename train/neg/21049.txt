I made the mistake of ordering from this restaurant online through GrubHub. BIG mistake. They brought the food in an hour, which is acceptable because of traffic and weather. Though they are 2.4 miles from the Fairmont. I specifically added a request to include forks, knives, plates, napkins. NONE OF THESE WERE INCLUDED. Those of you who eat Indian food know that it is nearly impossible to eat without these items. In the trash it goes - what a waste.We called the restaurant and they said it would take another hour to bring the items to us. Since they are 2.4 miles away, we found this unacceptable. We called GrubHub and just told them we would leave the food outside our door and we don't want to be bothered by them. We will go out to dinner tonight. HORRIBLE.
