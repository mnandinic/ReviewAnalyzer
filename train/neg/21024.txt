Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  I came to this place a decade ago when it was just a little street stand, and it was a magical experience.  Bostonians lined up on both sides for 15 minutes in either direction to get a taste of a decadent, luscious, buttery sandwich hot off the grill with your choice of meat and toppings that included, of all things, green beans.Today, Chacarero has become a victim of its own success.  Now located indoors, the line has vanished.  The grillman serves up a bland, even mealy, chicken and bean sandwich lacking any richness or real flavor.  Ordering was awkward, with your order taken before you even approach the grill in the back to check out sizes and meats, etc.  I wanted the experience to end.
