Here on vacation and decided to stop in for drinks. Hosts were confused upon us arriving. Hostess took off when escorting us to our table, venue was dark, server was unprofessional and didn't pay attention to any of our questions. She took our orders and brought us all the incorrect orders. Overall disappointing. Wouldn't recommend.
