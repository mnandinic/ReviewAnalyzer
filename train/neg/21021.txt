Chacarero is riding its long-ago earned reputation for a tasty and unique sandwich. Until this past weekend I had not been to Chacarero since they were on Province Street across from the Littlest Bar. My last meal there was good. How things have changed.The new place has all the character of a Baskin-Robbins, extremely limited seating (which is hidden behind some ridiculous 3/4 wall) and a confusing flow (do I order at the register? at the counter?). And who had the bright idea to cook the sweet potato fries in advance and put them into one of those rotating heat lamp displays you see you gas stations?My small combo sandwich ($8.25) featured dry chicken and budget, flavorless beef on a dry roll. Thank goodness for the avocado and green beans, the only source of moisture on the sandwich. Chacarero's time has come and gone, a result of resting on their laurels and letting the quality of the product drop. I say take a pass on this place.Please let me know what you think of this review by clicking a button below. Thanks.
