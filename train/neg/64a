I am not a fan of this place, but in terms of the Boylston/Newbury St set, this place fits perfectly. I found it to be a meat-market-y bar that's decorated in a bordello vampire style (lots of black and reds). The cocktails are over-priced and gimmicky, and the food inauthentic Mexican and also over-priced. The bathroom stalls are also weird (saloon doors held together by a hook in the middle?!). On my way out there was also a waiting line to get in...it's not a club, people... Having said that, the reason I give 1 star is because it's not my scene, but I can see why people like this place (as evidenced by all the 5 star gushing reviews)
