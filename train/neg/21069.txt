I read another review of the Shawarma that called its menu options "Middle Eastern comfort food." That's right-on. This place doesn't get it's fair share of attention, since it's straddled by cheap pizza places and a pub, but it's practically on campus and the food is pretty good.I've had a few wraps here - hummus, eggplant and falafel - and they all hit the spot. (Falafel was a little dry.) But my all-time favorite is maamoul. They're date-filled cookies (individually wrapped), and I've made many, many special trips to the Shawarma for a handful.Downside: I once had to sacrifice a couple of cookies since I only had a dollar in cash, and their old-school credit card processor wouldn't work.
