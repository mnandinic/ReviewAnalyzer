Ordered delivery from here: American Burger, Chicken Fingers, Cheese Fries.Burger was OK, didn't seem like a half pound but oh well.The fries were extremely soggy and mushy - I had to broil them before eating.The chicken fingers were definitely standard frozen pieces. From the description I believed I'd be getting BBQ tossed chicken pieces, but instead received bottled BBQ on the side. I also requested Bleu Cheese with them, which I did not receive.Will not be ordering again.
