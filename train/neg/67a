The bouncer/ID checker was very rude. 
We had a party of 8 and would have spent a serious amount of $$ there but we were not allowed inside due to my friends "foreign ID". 

I kinda understood that but the bouncer was just really rude. 
After we weren't allowed inside we were standing there planning what to do next and the bouncer came up to us and asked us to get out of the way because there was a line forming ... There wasn't a line being formed at all ... 

Anyway it looked like a decent place but customer service should probably be worked on. I know my friends and I, and any of our visiting guests will never waste our time with this place again.
