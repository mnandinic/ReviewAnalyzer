I have been here twice now and have had friends go on different occasions and we all say the same thing. The drinks are HORRIBLE. I paid $44 for a pitcher of VIRGIN margaritas. Hey Lolitas can you start putting alcohol in your cocktails? I felt so ripped off I was not about to order another drink after that. I went back again recently and ordered the sangria pitcher. How can you go wrong with wine right? Well surprised yet again. Lolitas figured out how to make non-alcoholic wine! I honestly do not even think it was wine because it tasted like cranberry juice and cinnamon. I would say the drinks are weak but that would mean they put alcohol. This place is horrible I don't care how trendy of a spot this place is I will NEVER come back. Everyone I know says the same. PS. Your gross cotton candy does not make up for your awful experience.
