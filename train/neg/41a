I loved this place when it opened. Tonight it was nearly empty, with an unpleasant smell. Closer to the kitchen the smell of garbage was overwhelming and the floor near the kitchen was filthy - looking like garbage water flowing from under the door to the kitchen. I will never go back. It makes sense that it was empty. Too bad.
