i was very excited about coming here for my birthday. we were seated quickly, but then waited, and waited some more. looking around, i saw that the people seated on both sides of me were also just waiting for servers to come around. When we finally ordered drinks, it had probably been about 20 minutes after we were seated. when the waiter finally came around again, we made sure to order apps and entrees, as only the good lord knew when he would come around again. 

the waiter apologized about them being under staffed, but after a 2 hour experience there i knew i would never come back. plus, if you look at reviews you can see this is a recurring problem that they don't seem to care about,

all that being said, everything we ate was excellent, i got the chicken napolitano, while the girl got a beef dish, both were great, but the overall experience wasn't the best. zero star service, and four star food nets out to 2.
