A little disappointed, especially considering the reviews on yelp.

My biggest pet peeve about the place was the fact that my steak was way over cooked. My girlfriend ordered hers medium well and I ordered mine medium rare. However, both of them were pretty much well done and you could not tell the difference between what was supposed to be medium well and medium rare. 

I asked the waiter about the side dish and all he said was "rice". However, it was rice with peppers and a mountain of other vegetables. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice to know.

Further, there were some other (minor) things that did not impress me. We were seated at a table that was in the middle of the room and we were so close to the table next to us that my elbows kept bumping into the guy next to me. Every time the waitress for the table next to us came by, I had to make sure I was not cutting the steak (so that my arms and elbows were wider than my body)  or she could not get by at all.

Also, the noise level was pretty high and in order to be able to understand the other person, you had to be pretty loud. The problem with that was once again the close proximity of all the other tables, allowing everyone to hear everything.

Overall a mediocre experience. Considering the price and the value for that price, no more than 2 stars from me.
