DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Worst service and food around. 
Got everything we didn't ask for. Didn't touch one of the dishes they gave us and, they still charged us for it.... and, they decided to move all the furniture around while we were eating. Awful! Would not eat there again if it was free!
