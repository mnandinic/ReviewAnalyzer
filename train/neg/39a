I came here for lunch with my coworkers as we wanted to try Puerto Rican food. The service was horrible. As we're trying to order our food, people came and cut us in line to order. We didn't get any apology for the wait but instead"hold on ladies!".

I tried to order a side of chicken and it was all gone however she just took it to the back. Then she was upset that I asked what the other sides were. Umm excuse where's the customer service? If you don't like your job then leave! I'm paying for the service so I expect to be treated nicely. 

The food was also expensive! I paid $10 for steak tips and rice and it was small. I will stick to restaurants in Boston where they actually have food, better service and you get more for your money!
