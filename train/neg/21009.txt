I used to LURVE this place, when it was an open window on the side of Filene's and a 20 minute wait for a sandwich.  Everything was hot, fresh, and tasty - my dog that BBQ chicken was delicious.  Top it with avocado, picante, and muenster cheese, and it was heaven during lunch hour!And then they moved.Now it's heat lamps and soggy bread.  Oh how you've changed. The last time I had a sandwich here, I was so underwhelmed I almost suggested we cut our losses and find somewhere else to grab a bite on that soggy day in July.Sniffle.
