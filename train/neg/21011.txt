This joint fell off. I went there a couple years back and it was delicious. Then I returned a month or so ago and it sucked. The sandwiches were tasteless. Somthing was missing, lacked flavor big time. My work buddy was conviced they had a bad day so he returned a week or so later. He told me that again the food was tasteless. Did I mention the food lacks taste?
