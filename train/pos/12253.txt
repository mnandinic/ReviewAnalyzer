Oh my God! I just ate here for the first time, and it is so good! This from a girl who "doesn't like Indian food"? I know, I know, so why'd I go in? Well my colleague had something from D'Guru last week that smelled divine, and since then I've been craving chicken tikka masala, the one Indian dish I know I like. It was on the board today and the rest, as they say, is history. The food is SO FRESH. It actually tastes like a meal you'd sit down to at someone's house--none of that tasting-remnants-of-freezing or tasting-additive-junk one can readily find in the Financial District. I love that inside, at the counter, they list the ingredients (in broad terms) to each of the dishes so a newbie to Indian food like me can figure out what to get. That's a huge plus. The joyous woman behind the counter, another plus. With a meal like the chicken tikka masala you get to choose a vegetarian side--I didn't know this and so when the woman asked what I wanted for the side, I was confused...but hell, those look like potatoes, I'll take those with my white rice! The potatoes rocked, too. I am not a naan expert, but I can say when you open the foil pack of naan it's nice and soft and chewy (don't know if it's supposed to be), but very quickly turns hard, almost like the effect one gets with microwaving bread. Dunno. But I can deal with just not eating the naan. Oh, and the chicken tikka masala was truly delicious--spicey, but not too spicey. Made my nose run a little...just like a good tikka masala should. I love it here!
