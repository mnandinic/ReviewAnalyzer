LOVED Merengue! Great Dominican food. The atmosphere is colorful and bright, reminding you of being in the DomincanRepublic.  ALL of the waitresses are beyond STUNNINGLY gorgeous (and they are fully clothed- versus somewhere like Hooters), and the one we had was especially nice, as well.

You get a LOT of food.  I mean, a LOT of food. From the appetizers to the entrees, they FEED you, and feed you well!

The food is delicious, seasoned just right, and won't break your bank either.

One thing: go in KNOWING that it is going to take a LONG TIME to get your delicious food.  You cannot be in a hurry. It's well worth the wait, too.

Also, on weekends, and at dinner, the place gets crowded and you will be waiting.

When you first walk in, there is a dining area and bar.  This is where all the sexy, single/not so single men sit and have drinks.  If you're a family, a couple, two girls, or whatever, ask to sit in the large dining area to the right.
