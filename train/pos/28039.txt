I was in here a few weeks ago with my wife and son, the bride is 100% Colombian, my son 50% and me 100% gringo but I speak the language.  The place has been completely remodeled and beautifully done.  It's always been immaculately clean and now the space it so much brighter and larger than it was before.  I had my usual breakfast - Calentado con Huevos Pericos (beans and rice alongside scrambled eggs mixed with green onion and fresh tomato).  Outstanding!  I also had a delicious arepa (unsweetened corn cake with fresh farm cheese).  The only downside was that I ordered coffee, which ended up being Sanka or some other nasty instant coffee (Colombians with instant coffee???)  I sent it back and the girl cheerfully replaced it with a delicious Colombian hot chocolate - to die for.  Problem solved.  Great quality for price.  This place is a gem.
