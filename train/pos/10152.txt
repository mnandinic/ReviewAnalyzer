I've only tried the Chicken Tikka Masala for the meat dish.  For the veggie dishes, I've tried Aloo Gobhi and a few others which I can't remember at the moment.

Food is cheap, seems very clean.  Sometimes I see a fly just sitting on the cans near the mouthpiece, so gotta beware of that.  Takes credit.

Portions are very decent.  Some reviewers complain about the naan, which I guess is legitimate depending on how much of a connoisseur you are.  

Has limited seating, so unless you arrive before noon expect to take out.

Would normally rate this 4 stars, but bumping it to a 5 since it seems to be the only palatable Indian restaurant around the area for lunch.
