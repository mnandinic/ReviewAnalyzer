I just had a wedding rehearsal dinner in their 3rd floor private dining room recently and couldn't have been happier with the venue, food, and service we received.  Jose & Taylor worked with us on every detail and were responsive with our requests & questions.  The room was clean, accommodating, and decorated for such an event and each of our guests not only raved about the food & wine, but also of the service of their staff.  I can also attest to that as plates and silverware were routinely cleared quickly and never an empty glass in the room!I recommend this to any couple looking for a similar event and be sure to try the mussels & veal osso buco!
