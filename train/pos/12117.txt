good and reasonably priced. I'd call it Central American.  They have a "chapín plate" and salvadoran dishes, so who knows which the restaurant truly is? Though, it is not Mexican.  All the same ingredients just variations and not super spicy by default.  Better in my mind.

Beans are top notch, so are the corn torillas, veggies, and meats.  I usually get the desayuno salvadoreño or the taco combination plate.  The former has this cheese that is salty and spongy.  I've had it elsewhere, and enamored, I just don't know what it's called nor how to find it.

Note:  the chicharrón is quite good but probably not like you're expecting; instead they are thick bacon like cuts of pig belly fat.  I know you're thinking "chicharrón is thick bacon cuts of pig belly fat" but trust; somehow it is different.
