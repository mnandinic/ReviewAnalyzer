I would give this place 5 stars based on the family experience and food, but settled for 4 due to the poor service. We went twice just to be sure that it wasn't an error with the first waitress. Unfortunately, the service was still bad after the second go around. The food is excellent... Some of the best Spanish cooking we have ever had, but the service was terrible. Waiting for the bill was like waiting for pigs to grow wings and fly. Same thing with asking for a drink or to let someone know my order was missing. Unless the service changes, we will order take out from now on.
