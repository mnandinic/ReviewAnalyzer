Just a dynamite spot, incredible value, everything satisfies.  Stuff your face for $6.

I know nothing of what Puerto Rican food is supposed to taste like, but I can say this is the best, and only, Puerto Rican food I've ever had.

The family-friendly warmth in the dining room, and from the proprietors, is worth the price.

I particularly like the chicken fajita combo plate and the savory plaintains, although friends have raved about the sweet kind.

The hot sauce that comes in yellow tubes at each table isn't particularly hot, but it is pretty flavorful.

Just a tremendously loving dining experience from start to finish.
