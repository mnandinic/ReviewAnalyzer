Can't believe I've lived in Watertown for a year and not stumbled il upon this place. The food it's outstanding. Had carve asada quesadilla today- check out my photo. It came with a rice and bean mixture and savory and sweet plantains on the side. Very filling. I almost never eat the rice and beans but devoured these. Can't wait for the patio to open. Hot sauce is amazing- housemade and available for purchase. My bar mate advised the salads are amazing and the short ribs are her favorite.
