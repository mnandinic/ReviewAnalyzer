Awesome! Terrific Peruvian in Boston. This is by far the best Peruvian restaurant I have been to in the US (I have spent a lot of time in South America). The Tacu Tacu de Mariscos was fabulous. The menu has all the hits, Causa, Aji de Gallina, Chica Morada, Loma Saltado etc. I can't wait to go back.
