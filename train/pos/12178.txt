This place has the best pupusas for so cheap (2$ each), and they're so big that two pupusas are filling enough for one person. I'm also a fan of the enchiladas and tacos. The whole menu is reasonably priced and has a delicious mix of mexican, guatemalan, and salvadorian food. The women who work there are very nice, and as far as I could tell, they all speak both english and spanish. Taqueria El Carrizal is a great little resataurant, and I'm so glad I've had the pleasure of eating there.
