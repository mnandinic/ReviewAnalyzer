This has got to be one of the best restaurants in the North End. A Italian and Peruvian flare. I went with 3 other people who each had a separate dish. We all tried the different dishes and all of them were amazing. The pork chop is their signature dish and the fish and meat are fresh and delicious. The service was great. There was no feeling of being rushed and we went on a busy night. Highly recommend this neat little place.
