This place really is a gem tucked in the midst of the south end's residential buildings. There is a cute makeshift outdoor patio (the corner of the sidewalk) with a good amount of small tables. When you step inside you're welcomed by beautiful traditional decor: paintings, old photographs, and various other trinkets.I came here on a Friday night at 7pm and we were seated immediately.FoodRoasted Portobella Arepa, $15:  Portobella filled arepa made with sweet roasted corn and anise seeds--with saut√©ed mushrooms, sweet corn, spinach, and huitlachoche sauce (had to look this up: fungus delicacy that gives an earthy mushroom corn flavor). This was my first time trying arepa and I liked it. I think some parts were a little too burnt for my taste. Nonetheless, it was a simple dish and I felt like I could munch on them forever. This came with 4 quarters."La Primera" Burger, $14.50: Pork/chorizo patty, manchego cheese, Peruvian criollo salad with rocoto aioli, chipotle ketchup and truffled salted hand cut fries. Okay.....they had me at chorizo, manchego, and chipotle. Talk about a savory combo with a nice little kick of spiciness. The bun could've been toasted a little more (it actually felt a little cold).Mechada empanadas, $8.75: Venezuelan style stewed shredded beef with a fresh green salad tossed with queso blanco, sherry vinaigrette. These babies were stuffed with so much beef and the dough was on the softer side. The salad was good for something that was premixed with dressing (not soggy or overwhelming for a vinaigrette).Pabellon criollo, $13.50: shredded beef, white rice, black beans and plantains. The plantains were so good I wish the dish came with more than 3 pieces. Simple ingredients but so good.
