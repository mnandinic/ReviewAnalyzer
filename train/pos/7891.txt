Having only recently started working in the Kendall Sq. area again after a 12y absence, I'm overjoyed to be able to return to Izzy's, and even happier to see that they haven't changed.
Yummy, large portions, reasonable price. Many others have discussed the details so I won't reiterate. I've been 2x in a week and expect to be returning about weekly, when the weather's reasonable for the 10m walk from work.
