Taranta is one of my favorite restaurants in the North End! As one of the first restaurants you pass on Hanover as you enter the North End, it could be missed with its simple yet elegant facade. But don't walk by it!! You'll be sorry you missed out on its fantastic Italian-Peruvian menu! The service here is THE BEST!! And the food & wine are divine! I love the mushroom pasta dish called pappardelle con funghi porcini and also as good if you're interested in a traditional pasta dish is the pasta pomodoro della Nonna. Try this place!! You'll be happy you did!! Also, start the night off with one of their delicious Peruvian cocktails!!
