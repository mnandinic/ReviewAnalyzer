I've been looking for a good Peruvian place to go to since moving to Boston from NYC and I've finally found it.  My fiance, who really doesn't really have strong opinions about what eats for the most part, even thought about moving to the neighborhood so he could be closer to this restaurant.

Rincon Limeno's food is so much better than Flor de Mayo's (NYC) in so many ways.  We started dinner with an order of their chicken empanada.  I've never had it come with powdered sugar on top and raisins inside, but somehow it works together and made it that much tastier.  YUM!   I got the Lomo Saltado and it was amazing!  The strips of beef were just cooked through, the fries were crispy, and the tomato, red onion, and cilantro sauce was plate-lickin' good.  The arroz con pollo was just okay for me, but my fiance just couldn't stop raving about it.  It really didn't look appetizing since the chicken blended in with the rice and it came with a side of boiled potatoes with some kind of creamy-cheesy sauce, but I will have to admit that the green rice was AMAZING!!!  I mean, I could eat that alone as a meal and be completely happy.  Their portions were huge, but we somehow managed to eat all of it and ordered some alfajores for desert.  Good thing it came in a take out box because we couldn't eat more than 1 each.  And yes, those little anise cookies with dulce de leche were also amazing.
