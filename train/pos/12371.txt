I love you D'Guru.

No, really I do.

You've improved the selection of food in DTX immensely with your huge portions and affordable prices.  Your rotating menu means that I won't get bored even when I obsessively eat here every day for a week and a half.  Your employees always great me with a smile, never chastise me when I attempt to say things like aloo baingain and it comes out sounding remarkably like "I'm an idiot" and the cashier always remembers that I don't want a bag to throw away in the office.  

My experiences with Indian food are limited to other people ordering for me and buffets so I am certainly no expert but everything I've had here has been delicious.  On a side note I've straight up seen people from Mumbai Chopstix buying their naan at Trader Joe's and I myself have purchased naan there and it doesn't look like this.  Maybe it is frozen but it's never been bad.

If you want a seafood curry I'd recommend going early in the day as the quantity of seafood diminishes later in the afternoon otherwise stick with the veg options for around $7 (!) and enjoy an embarrassment of riches as you choose from the lion's share of the dishes offered that day.  What a lovely change of pace when you're used to seeing all meat all the time around here.

Besties forever  D'Guru
