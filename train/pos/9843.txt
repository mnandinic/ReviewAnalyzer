This my first try at Peruvian food. If this is what Peruvian food taste like all over, I am hooked. Be aware the food is plentiful. One  meal is good for 2 unless you eat like my husband. I had the fried seafood with pickled seafood dip. Excellent. The second meal is Tacu Tacu. It's kind of like a curried seafood, spread over rice and beans. No words to describe how delectable this is. If you are Caribbean, you'll especially like both of these meals. The dip that comes with the fried fish taste a bit like conch souse. Just glad I don't live to close to this place because I might be eating here every day.
