This is my FAVORITE restaurant! Have been coming here since before I was born.... litterally... my mom came here when she was pregnant with me in her belly haha.  I have only tried three things on the menu and everytime I go I order the same thing.  I get the typical izzy's plate with white rice and enyucados with the special yellow sauce.  Definatelly not "healthy" if you're on a diet but it's absolutely delicious! The plate is so big that you can eat it for two separate meals! Honestly wish i could give them 100 stars haha
