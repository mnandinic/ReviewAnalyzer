Izzy's Jamaican Beef Patties are the best!! Always served hot and tasty with a kick of spice. Paired with their selection of Guava juice, it made a perfect lunch.

The first time I was introduced to it I became addicted and stopped by Izzy's at least once or twice a week.  A few times I forgot about their annual vacation and was left craving the patty even more. I only gave four stars as opposed to 5 because I haven't really tried anything else on the menu. My friend loves their fried pork and liked their steak tip dinner. I also heard, while waiting in line, other Malden people gushing about their fish cakes, which typically sells out daily.

The service is always friendly and helpful. I hope to try more things from them in the future if I can ever get my self to order something else besides the patty.
