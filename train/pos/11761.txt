I had this place for the first time a few weeks ago when I was definitely craving Hispanic food. I'm originally from Miami and Salvadorean food is the closest thing in Boston to Nicaraguan food (my parents are Nicaraguan). I ordered chicken and it was pretty good. Not the best I've had in Boston, but I'd definitely go there again.

Their horchata was nice and milky. And the pupusas were awesome.

I'd definitely recommend this place.
