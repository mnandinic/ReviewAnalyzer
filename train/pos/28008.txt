This has been my favorite Puerto Rican Restaurant. I been here a total of five times for various occasions and I never been disappointed. The service was excellent.  The waitress was very attentive and exhibited great customer service.  The best alcapurria I ever had tasted.  The food was good  and cooked to perfection with its savory authentic Caribbean taste.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
