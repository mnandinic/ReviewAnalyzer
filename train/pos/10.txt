Everything about this place was amazing!! The atmosphere, decor, staff, and of course the most important, the food.First, we began with the Mini Costillitas (apple cider, slow-steamed, baby-back ribs with guava BBQ, tapas-style). There were four baby-back ribs doused in a puddle of the amazing sauce. This was an excellent teaser for the main course. Bonus point for the staff: Our server came over with the wet wipes for our hands (of course I got a little mess) and he opened the it up for me because I looked like I was struggling.. oops. But we just laughed it off. Anyways, back to the food.I don't remember what the name of my dish was (and it's not on the menu on Yelp or its website), so I'll just describe it.It was a slab of beef brisket with grilled asparagus on top of it. in the middle of the brisket and below the asparagus was the best part of the dish that complimented the beef perfectly. It some sort of mix like the inside of a fried crab cake and was beyond delicious. The meat itself was so tender and not tough at all. There was a green sauce on the side below the meat that added a little citrus kick but wasn't too strong to overpower the main dish.By the end of the meal, I was really craving a churro. Unfortunately, the kitchen had closed about half an hour before we finished. I checked the menu and realized they didn't have churros. But that's okay, would have still felt just as great about this place with or without the churros. Definitely will be back to try the arepas and empanadas!!
