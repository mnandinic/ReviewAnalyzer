Agree that it's a hidden gem (for those in the East Cambridge/Technology Square area). I have had the rice, beans, and salad (5 + change, incl tax) and beef patty and other fried treats.

After checking out the photos I need to try plantains+ stew...

A small place, but I have been able to sit in with co-workers. Makes for a pleasant "leisurely" (~20-30 min) lunch of real food. Also good for take-out.

Family establishment and family friendly--I love that!

Really great value for something that's not burgers, pizza, though you could get subs, if you wish.

There's a TV that plays news and soaps...

They accept credit cards for purchases greater than $5...but I can't remember paying by cc.

At corner of Harvard x Windsor--highly recommended...but closed for Memorial Day on Monday.
