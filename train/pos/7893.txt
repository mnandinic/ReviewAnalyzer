Again, disclaimer: The star rating is based on what I expect it to be and not based on what it is compared to other nearby eateries.

Second disclaimer: I am used to very good, very inexpensive, high-quality ethnic food. You expect nothing less when you've grown up in the mecca of ethnic restaurants known as Queens, NY.

So, take that into consideration as you read what I have to say.

1) The food is OK. It's good for its price, but it's definitely not as authentic as it could taste, which is weird, given that Puerto Rican food is never very spicy, so I don't know how much more they could change recipes to appease the mainstream public.
2) The serving sizes are huge. When I order white rice, I get enough to feed a family of five...and their dog.
3) The location is not super convenient. Did anyone notice that it says it's in the Kendall/MIT area but it's at the Central T stop? Reason why: This is actually in Area Four, by Fletcher Maynard Academy.
4) The chicken isn't very flavorful. I've had great chicken, I've had good chicken, I've had OK chicken, I've had almost-OK chicken, and I've had bad chicken. I've had almost all of these except for great at Izzy's.
5) Good & quick lunch/dinner
6) Very small, almost impossible to eat in, even if you want to.
