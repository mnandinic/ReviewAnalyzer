As you can see when you walk in and by surveying the clippings and photos on the walls, Izzy's is a neighborhood staple. It's a super familiar and welcoming environment, and you can immediately tell how popular it is within the community.

I've been meaning to try more of the menu, but every time I go there I find myself unable to resist ordering the roast pork which is soft and shredded, carnitas style. It also comes with a yellow gravy that is out of this world, although the pork has plenty of flavor to do without it. I've also enjoyed the pork chops which are thin and fried crispy, the stewed chicken, and a breakfast sandwich. Although they were all good to really good, the pork is my clear favorite.

I'm a bit of a hot sauce addict, but a few times I've found myself regretting that I added one of the many hot sauces they have to the food--it honestly doesn't need it; the flavors are so dense and well-developed that the hot sauce can easily drown them out. All of the meals are served with either white or yellow rice (get the yellow), salad and beans or plaintains (fried or sweet). The sides are just as stellar as the main part of each dish.

If you're in the mood for great Puerto Rican food or even just a quick hot sandwich, Izzy's is a must. I only wish they were open on Sundays too haha.
