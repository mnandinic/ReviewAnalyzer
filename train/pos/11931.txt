After 13 years of living in CA, one thing I knew I was going to miss was Mexican/Latin food. However, I was surprised to see the amount of taquerias that popped up in the Boston area. And slowly, I was disappointed by every single one.

El Carrizal has fast become my husband and I's favorite joint for some good, authentic Mexican/Latin food. We took so long to try it out because it looked like a more formal, sit down restaurant (instead of a fast, to-go type taqueria). Yet, the prices are extremely affordable, the food is plentiful, and the service is warm and wonderful.

On my first visit, I had the Combinacion Salvadorena, which included a pupusa (of choice), salvadorean enchilada and chicken tamal. All for $7.99!! It was amazing. However, the "simple" rice & beans of Latin cuisine is my favorite and El Carrizal really hits the spot with theirs. It seems like such a simple dish, but I am amazed at how bland and terrible other places can make them. My go to dish is now just 2 pupusas and a side of rice & beans ($8).

Their tacos and burritos are wonderful too because their meat is good. Once again, I've been so underwhelmed by other taquerias. It's not like a taco has that many ingredients. The star is clearly the meat and it needs to be flavorful. And when it is, you don't need to load things like sour cream, salsa, or even guacamole to make it taste wonderful.

Thanks for bringing simple and beautiful Latin food into Boston!
