My friend brought me here after a long day of work and we were seated right away. The decorations were not too crazy but I felt "warm"? If that even makes sense.

Their food was delicious. The ONLY complaint I had was that their guava smoothie was just a tad bit too sweet. But was save by their flan. It was amaze-balls.
