I love this place! I've been there three times in the last 2 months and it never disappoints. I'm a huge fan of their red sangria, and each entree I've had has been delicious. I recommend the calamari as an appetizer. I've had the fish tacos as well as the chicken and beef, and I recommend both entrees. The staff has always been super friendly and helpful! Can't wait to go back!
