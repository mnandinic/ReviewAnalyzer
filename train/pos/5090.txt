Another couple and my wife and I went to dinner here last night.  Ok, the location is not the best -- and as other reviewers said .. I could see why you may the location can be intimidating...   If you can get past all that and find a close parking spot, you have to give this place a shot.  

This was my first time eating Dominican food...

What we ordered:

El presidente beer - thumbs up
Margaritas -- thumbs up
Pi√±a colada - thumbs up

For apps:

Fried Cheese and salami -- surprising yummy.  Better than I thought.
Fried cassava and garlic dipping sauce - I guess all I can is "it was different".  Garlicky

For dinner:

I had the Fried plantain cups filled with lobster and shrimp --   "Outstanding"
Wife had -- the seafood paella -- generous portions size (true for all we ordered).  Lots of seafood.  
Grilled seafood feast -- now that was awesome too.  Again lots of food.  Very fresh.   Grilled perfectly.  Flavored well.  
Chiccarron de pollo -  my friend who has lived in the DR was craving that, and he gave the thumbs up!

Atmosphere was great.  Live music.  Outstanding service.   We had a twenty minute wait -- we didn't have reservations.   It was sat night around 7:30 pm.  The staff was excellent and kept us updating on the status of tables.  

Great people, great company and great food.  Price was right too.  
 
Give it a try.
