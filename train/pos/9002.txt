Yum yum! Great food. We had the Rincon Limeno seafood dish. One plate was enough to feed two! (we also had a plate of delicious mussels before the main course). The food presentation was wonderful. The chef really knows what they are doing. Best sangria I've had in Boston. Great service. My fianc√© and I will definitely return.
