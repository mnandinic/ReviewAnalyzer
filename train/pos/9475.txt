The Cerviche was great - I didn't think I would like it but wow. Light, fresh, spicy -  Large portions, good food - also had the lamb (good but not as great). The Peruvian chicken soup was thick, tasty, and filling - the large portion came with rice and salad - this alone would be a big hearty meal for 10 bucks. I will be back most certainly.
