Don't judge a book by its cover. This place might look ordinary from the outside, but walk in and you would finish the food to the last kernel on your plate. This place is bang on money.

For $8.50, they serve you two vegetarian entr√©es, rice and two naans. So much for $8.50. The food tastes like it were home cooked. I have been going to this place for three straight days now. They have a rotating menu so you never get bored.
I would highly recommend this place for a takeout.
