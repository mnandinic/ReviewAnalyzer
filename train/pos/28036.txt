Probably the second time I've had Colombian food ... But nevertheless, it was delicious.  It was helpful to have someone who is Colombian in our party who helped us order .We got in about 1pm and this was our first meal of the day. The wait for the food was a little long (maybe it seemed long cause I felt hangry) but food was worth the wait! Loved the Arepa Con Queso (corn cake with cheese) to start off. And of course got the Bandeja Paisa...the pork belly is so crunchy and flavorful.Def will make a trip back in the future
