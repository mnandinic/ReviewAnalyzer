My love for this place started a few months after I moved here from Puerto Rico. I was extremely homesick, and needed something familiar. Well as soon as I walk in, it hits me.The smells, the sounds, the decor...It akk screams small Puerto Rico town cafeteria, I loved it. As soon as the owner learns im Puertorican, he pulls out the bottle of coquito and serves me a drink.

Yup. I love this place. The food is amazing, very genuine, and the service is great. I would really recommend this place.
