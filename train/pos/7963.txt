Thankfully, it's a bit of walk from where I live and work, but the food is that good.  I dream about the roast pork.  The maduros are excellent, and the rice and beans could probably be a meal in itself.  Washing down a meal here with a Goya fruit drink or their home-made ginger beer makes it even better.

I've come here once for lunch and once for dinner, and both times I've been struck by how the patrons really love this place.  I've seen a wide range of Cambridge cops, locals, MIT students, etc.   Many of the customers seemed to know the owners.  My father still talks about how yummy his food was, and if my parents ever move here, he will certainly try to become BFF with the owners as well.
