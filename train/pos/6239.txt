8 years ago while working at Logan I befriended this guy who introduced me to what would become one of my favorite restaurants/meals I've ever had. Nestled in East Boston by the Victory Pub (Orient Heights) lies this gem of a restaurant. First off let me say that I've only had one dish over the past 8 years but man is it the best tasting Tipico plate I've ever had. The plate is dubbed as the "Traditional Colombian Dish" and consists of the following for $11.00:

1 Fried Egg
Bowl of stewed beans (beyond tasty)
Steak
Sausage
Pork
Salad

Top top it off the staff is super friendly and could be some of the best looking women I've ever seen.

This is a great place to shake a hangover on Sunday mornings.
