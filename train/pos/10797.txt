This place looks like Little Havana, tastes like Heaven, and has totally earned a repeat customer.

The food was so good it made me want to weep and the margarita was arguably the best (and strongest) I've had in YEARS...

It was moderately priced and is worth every single penny.

No point in a longer review because words only get in the way.

nom nom nom nom nom.
