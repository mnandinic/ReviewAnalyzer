The best place you have never heard of. Tucked away from the main restaurant square in Kendall, Izzy's provides that "home away from home" cooked meal. Note that they are closed on Sunday.

With a variety of daily specials from safe to adventurous, recommend trying them all. Get started with the Friday and Saturday roast pork special. The pork is slow-roasted and extremely tender with a side of mustard sauce, yellow rice (or white if you wish, but pick yellow) and beans. The beans are hearty and smoky. Try a bit of the pork with hot sauce provided table-side. The ox tail (available Tuesday and Saturday) and stewed goat (not available on Wednesday) come in a casserole dish in a savory sauce. The ox tail is also very tender reminiscent of a blend between corned beef and brisket, served on the bone. The goat is served cubed and also on the bone. Both dishes are also served with rice and beans. If you are feeling most adventurous try the tripe soup (available daily) The broth is satisfying with potatoes, celery, and tripe. The earthy tripe brings a unique element to this dish, perfect for a snowy wintry evening.

The Montanero plate, with slices of beef, is also a great value and comes with an egg and fried plantain in addition to the rice and beans. While the atmosphere is very casual, come here for a hearty meal prepared with soul. You might have leftovers if you don't want to clean your plate!
