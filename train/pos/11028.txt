Why haven't I been here before?  What was I thinking?  The food was good, my drink was fine, there was a live band (and dancing).  Great service from the door onward - charming host, great server.  All in all, comfortable and fun.  Perfect for a cold Friday night.  And Florina, I think you mean the arepas.  (We had the chicken and avocado arepa - small but very flavorful.)
