Had a few delicious things here: Arroz con Camarones (Shrimp Rice), Tostones, Maduros, Bistec Merengue. Also the Queso y Salami Frito app was perfect. As a side, do yourself a favor and get the Rice and Beans. It's a staple and its prepared perfectly.

A few things were not as good as I expected: Sangria (Margarita was better but still low on alcohol), Chicharrones (very tough, if you like hard meat they are for you), Yuca Frita (they look like mozzarella sticks, quite odd), Mofongo was weak too.

The drinks we tried were not very alcoholic and excessively sweet so I would just stick to a beer (Corona) unless you just love sugary drinks. The last complaint I have is that the temperature on a Fri afternoon was surprisingly low in there. It was as though they didn't want to turn on the heat which is a real drag in Boston. This was our second time there and we didn't have that issue the first time (fri night) so perhaps it was just a strange oddity.
