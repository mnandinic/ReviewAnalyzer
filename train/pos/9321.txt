For all of you that don't know what real authentic Peruvian is..I'm gonna tell you. I'm 100% Peruvian and the food here is as close to authentic as you are going to find in New England. Nothing will get as close unless you are in the motherland.

I love this place. The food, service, and atmosphere is great.

My recommendations will be the Ceviche, Tallarines Verdes, and Lomo Saltado if you're a newbie.

Definitely check it out!
