So I don't venture into Easty that often, so coming here was a real treat.   This place has some seriously good mexican and central american food.  I was most impressed with the pupusas.  I got the fajitas and damn were they good.I also appreciated he drink selection as well.  Not everyday where you can have a Gallo (Guatemalan).   Ironically I came here around the 5th of May, but we were seated fairly quickly.   Great spot to watch local families eat and enjoy one another's company on a sunday afternoon.I'll be back, fo sho.
