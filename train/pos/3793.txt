LOVE THIS PLACE. Everything I have tried here has been freaking delicious and has left my mouth watering for weeks. I drive by this restaurant on my way to and from work every day, and I stare at the storefront hungrily every single time.

Their bistec is out of this world. The pechuga a la plancha is simple but delicious. Though I've never actually ordered one of their seafood dishes (they can get pricey), I have tried a bite here and there when a friend orders seafood, and have never been disappointed. As for side dishes and apps, the shrimp ceviche is fresh and light, and their frituritas (fried meat sampler) is anything but light, but is still a must-try. The yuca frita comes with this delicious garlic dipping sauce that I dream about for weeks after I eat here. Of course there's plain old rice and beans-- I don't know what Dominicans do to make plain white rice so good but once I start eating it I can't stop. Their mojitos and sangria are divine, but on the strong side.

Any day now, I'm going to cave in to temptation and stop by here after work. It's getting harder to resist every time I pass by.

Tip: Avoid coming here in the daytime because service is sloooow. Dinner is the way to go!
