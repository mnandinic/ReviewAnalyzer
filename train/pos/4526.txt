After seeing the raving reviews about the food and the cautionary tales regarding the location, I was a bit hesitant to try this place out for the first time by taking my wife for dinner.  Instead, I decided to bail from work and scout The Merengue out for lunch on my own.  Lucky for me, the special for Wednesdays is "Pernil" (Pork Shoulder) which is not on the menu.  It was excellent!  I added some mofongo to round it out into a great Latin meal.  But, maybe it is the suburbanite in me, if I come back here, I'd much prefer to do so during the day and bring our banged up second car.  If this place was anywhere else, I could see me coming on a regular basis.
