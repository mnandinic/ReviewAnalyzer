I love going to Vegigantes specially with all my Puertorrican and Hispanic friends. The food yessss awesome, the service is really friendly. When I go to Vegigantes I feel the warm like for a second I'm back home in Puerto Rico. I great suggestion if you are going with a group or just want to grab dinner make a reservation, cause it gets packed by 7:00 p.m.   Another thing its a bit pricey but when you think about where and when I'm going to eat a Mofongo again, you totally forget about it, cause the amount of food served and the quality is just perfect!!
