EASTIE?!?! K, it's most definitely a bit sketch, but I would get in a knife fight and a half to get to this place.

I have been told by a certain Anthony Bourdain that Peruvian food pretty much the most surprising food you will find in South America. Metropolitan I believe is the word. As far as I'm concerned, the only words I can think of are GET IN MY BELLY!

For serious, though.

CEVICHE MIXTO: Some people get freaked by the fact that the fish is cooked by lime juice and not traditionally over fi-ah!!!! Add the crunchy corn, fresh corn, and veggies in with the fish and it's a party in your mouth.

ANTICUCHOS: Bull heart? Really? YES! Marinated to perfection and simply put, yum.

PAPAS a la HUANCAINA: K, I didn't really care for this dish it was a bit too eggy for my tastes, but for those of you who do like eggs, it's basically a halved potato covered with a flavorful eggy/creamy sauce.
UPDATE: Just had this in 2014, DAMN it's good! Waaaay better than before, it's actually kind of amazing!

LOMO SALTADO: I've had it before and loved it, I really liked it here as well.

TACU-TACU de MARISCOS: Unbelievably flavorful. Lots of things going on. My Seafood was a touch over-cooked, but everything else was perfection.

SECO de CABRITO: Tender, tender goat. Caution there are bones, but seriously some of the best treated meat, and tacu-tacu to boot.

CHUPE de CAMARONES: HOKAY! This was the piece de resistance. I was really full and could not stop eating this. It was extremely hot and I still couldn't stop eating. It's that good. It's basically a shrimp soup with so much flavor...dreamt about it for a week. And have been having occasional hunger pangs for it again. It's one of the more expensive dishes on the menu, but it's definitely worth it.

I will be coming back here with the Peruvian Biff. Blue line, knife fights and all.
