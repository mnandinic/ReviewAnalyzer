Fantastic flavors and great everything.

The leche de Tigre was soupy heaven-ness. The plantains were excellent. The papa rellena, extremely tasty. The Papa a la Huancaina was vegetarian and had me practically licking the plate (that cheese sauce is amazing). I wasn't a huge fan of the mussels, but others at my table gobbled them down. The purple corn juice was refreshing and delicious.

Look, I don't know what to say, I live in Porter Square and rarely venture off to Eastie, but I want to go back kind of immediately. Go with a pack of friends so you can get everything.

(Note: While this isn't an ideal place for vegetarians, they were very flexible and came up with some veggie versions of dishes (or as they called them, "no chicken no beef no fish no nothing"), and the dishes that were vegetarian were excellent.)
