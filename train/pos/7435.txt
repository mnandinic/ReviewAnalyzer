After the meal and service I experienced tonight at Sea Breeze, I had to give them 5 stars.  I ordered the Carne Asada made with a hanger steak, and it comes topped in a Chimichurri sauce.  Choice of 2 sides and I picked beans and sweet plaintains.  The steak was delicious.  It came sliced and with a generous topping of herbal/garlicky Chimicurri sauce.The sweet plantains were a nice contrast to the steak and sauce.  I liked the beans, yeah they were a little runny but I liked them anyway.  It was the best Carne Asada I've ever had. A blend of Mexico, Argentina, and Dominican Republic.  Sea Breeze isn't really a Mexican restaurant, but their rendition of Mexican along with the Dominican items, is a winner.  The server was cheerful and efficient.  This was my second visit and I'll keep coming back for more.
