I went to Sea Breeze on their opening weekend, I am always down to support a new business in Dorchester. I had a mole dish which wasn't on the menu as a vegetarian dish so I was very appreciative. The mole itself was delish, yum! But the vegetarian enchiladas were lacking cheese or beans, it only consisted of tomatoes, peppers and onion. I am not that big of a raw onion fan so when I picked these out there was really not much left in there.
My one other complaint was we had a really nice waiter who chatted up a storm, but because he chatted SO much we ended up being there for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. There were only two or three other tables but it was really hard to get his attention because he always seemed to be off talking to a table or someone in the kitchen. So I think the staff could be a teeny more attentive to the customers, there are only about six or seven tables to cover. And this place is a lot pricier than I think Mexican food needs to be. I am still very excited to see a Mexican restaurant in the community tho, I'm sure they will work out the kinks soon.
