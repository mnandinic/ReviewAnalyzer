Don't even get me started with my fat self. OMG the food is so bomb, the lady staff is very nice, I absolutely love their homemade arroz (rice) con (with) gandules, tostones (fried plantains), pollo guisado (stewed chicken), pechuga de pollo a la plancha (chicken breast on the grill), the chicken and beef patties (empanadas), WHAAAT?!. Love it here!! 5 stars.
