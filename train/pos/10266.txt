Oh man I love this place... i love indian food so perhaps im biased but this is the closest place for me to get indian near my job and i love it!

Their menu rotates so be sure to check on their website if theyre serving your fave that day, although if you go with something else you may be surprised! (I had some chicken curry the other day because they were not serving my precious lamb curry that day and i think im a convert!)

If you get a serving of curry + rice + samosa + naan itll be about $9 or so. Not too bad really, if you split the meal in half you got a solid lunch and a bombin' dinner (delicious, spicy dinner!).

The staff is nice, food is good and prices arent bad. They also take cards :)
