I've Eaten at Merengues once...the food was yummy I enjoyed my dinner with a Presidente ,the Vibe was a Island feel which was very nice..however the tables are very close an was quite uncomfortable ...the service was okay... But the Greetings from waitresses could be more inviting ..I Love Dominican Cuisine an I would recommend eating there.
