Hands down, best Peruvian food...and authentic.  The star is the ceviche...ALL OF THEM.  They strike the perfect balance of letting the fish shine and giving it just the right amount of citrus.  And then with the thinly sliced onions...wow.  The other thing they do so well is fried seafood.  The squid is cooked perfectly, every time.  We get a Classico almost every time we are there so we can get the ceviche and the fried fish.

The restaurant is almost always full...because it is excellent.  I travel for this one, and you should too.
