Great Colombian food, but I was not impressed with the beans.  For me, one of the hallmarks of Colombian food is flavorful beans, but these were very bland.  Everything else, though, was really good.  My husband loved his ceviche, and I got the tostones rancheros.  They were really good--Crunchy, fried green plantains, shredded meat, avocado, and I don't remember what else because it has been a month, but it was really good, and I recommend it.The place itself is quite nice, especially being a neighborhood spot.  It's very clean and spacious, there are lots of tables and bar seating, and there appears to be a very steady following within the community.  We came into a fairly slow restaurant at 4PM, and as we approached five, the crowds rolled in.  They have a large, varied menu and authentic food.  I would definitely come back.  It wasn't the best Colombian food I've had, but satisfying and certainly worth a return visit.
