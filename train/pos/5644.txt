Came here on a Friday night with a group of 20 for a birthday celebration. We made a reservation in advance. They were able to sit us in the corner of the room, which worked out perfectly! The servers were very quick. Food took maybe about 20min at most (pretty fast considering our group size) and all of our food came out at the same time.

Food:
Sangria - probably one of my favorite

Queso y Salami Frito, $4: fried cheese and Dominican salami. the fried cheese was gooey inside and slightly crispy on the outside. The salami flavor paired nicely with the cheese.

Sopa o Asopao de Mariscos, $20: Seafood Soup or Gumbo with Lobster, Shrimps, Calamari & Mussels. I ordered the gumbo but the consistency was too soupy (maybe it was actually the soup?) The amount of seafood was generous. Seasoning was delicious.
