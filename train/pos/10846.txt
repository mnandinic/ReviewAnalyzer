I likeit here alot -- i have been a couple times with different people and loved it both times. The food is great, the atmosphere is VERY 1955 Cuba (a good thing!) and there is ample free parking.  It's some of the best latin food I've had in Boston. My only quibble was the lighting was a little too low to read the menus easily.
