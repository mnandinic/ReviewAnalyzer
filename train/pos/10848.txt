Went here for the first time last night. AMAZING!

Strawberry Mojito was declicious and then we had the Nachos for an appetizer. Honestly the best Nachos I have ever had (and I eat a LOT of nachos!)

For my meal I tried the Pabell√≥n Criollo which was Shredded beef simmered in very finely chopped vegetables. Served with white rice, fried plantains and black beans

The Fried Plantains were also probably the best I have ever tasted. and the beef was very flavorful.

ORDER THE HOT SAUCE with your meal (extremely Hot!!!) But delicious.

Cannot wait to go back here!
