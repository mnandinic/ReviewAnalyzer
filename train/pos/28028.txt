Wow! We have wanted to try Taranta for a while, but Restaurant Week 2014 (and kids being with grandparents) finally allowed the opportunity. Go there tonight! From friendly service and great wine recommendations to food that was to die for, this place is it.We did RW three course dinner. I had PEI mussels braised in magic (seriously), the best gnocchi I have ever tasted with a lamb ragout that I could have eaten all night, and hazelnut mousse that was dreamy. All that and wonderful, fun street-frontage on Hanover in the summer. Hats off to the chef and our server (wonderful and knowledgeable blonde from Argentina, sorry I don't recall her name). DH had the caprese (featuring homemade mozzerella), a fish called plaiche that was delectable and flavorful and beautifully presented, and also finished with the mousse. First time in the North End that we haven't gone out for cannoli to Modern afterward.Even with a table of six sitting right next to us it was a splendid and romantic dinner. Thanks Taranta!
