Dominican cuisine as good as it gets!

If you're tired of the same old American, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese restaurants, you might want to try a Latin one such as Merengue. This place is renowned for it's Dominican dishes. Don't be fooled by the appearance of the restaurant since this is nestled in one of Boston's toughest neighborhoods which is going through a revitalization stage thanks to the Mayor. Like most things, it's what is inside that matters like this restaurant.

We came here for a farewell dinner for my fiance's coworker. The theme for that week was "South of the Border" and we landed here.  Inside you'll find a lots of vivid colors on the wall, paintings, and other decors. The waitress was super friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. We started off with a few appetizers such as Ceviche de Camarones (Shrimps Marinated in Lemon Juice), Frituritas (Fried Meat Sampler Platter), and Mofongos (Mashed Plantains). We also ordered a few beers - The Presidente. Everything we ordered there came out with huge portions. The quality and taste surpassed our expectations.
We all ordered our own individual dinner meals. I ordered the Almejas en Salsa Criolla (Mussels in Creole Sauce) and my fiance ordered the Chicharron de Cerdo (Fried Pork Skins). Our meals was fantastic and with huge portions!

This restaurant is good for groups at a moment notice and is also known to do some catering. Street parking is the only option here but you won't have a problem finding a spot.

Overall good food, good folks and fun. Sorry Mc Donald's but Merengue has you beat in those catergories.
