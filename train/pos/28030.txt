Large variety of food.They start you off with olive oil and bread, continue with the drinks selection, and then our Anticucho de carne came out! Sooooo good! Excellent meat, a bit spicy, with the right amount of olive oil to dip our bread into.Main course? They have everything! I'd suggest asking the waiter for recommendations to see what their specialty is/what they have particularly fresh that day (regarding fish.)Very pleasant atmosphere and excellent service.
