Izzy's Restaurant and Sub Shop has been probably the best Spanish food we have had since moving to Boston. The two of us ordered enough food for probably about 4 people and ate everything. The portions are huge and the prices are incredibly cheap. The staff was incredibly nice and welcoming as soon as we stepped foot inside. If you want great Puerto Rican food, make the trip to Izzy's and you won't be disappointed.
