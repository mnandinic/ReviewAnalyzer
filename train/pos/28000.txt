Delicious! They give huge portions and I couldn't finish mine but I definitely tried. I got the chicken fajita and it was amazing. I don't know what the beans are or what sauce they're in but they were also delicious. It was a nice surprise from just plain black beans.I went there during the busiest time, Sunday at noon, so it was chaos. The servers were very calm and attentive despite the large amount of people. The prices are also pretty reasonable and it's easy to share a plate.It's just a good, authentic Salvadoran restaurant and I definitely recommend it.
