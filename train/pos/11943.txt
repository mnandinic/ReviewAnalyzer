Finally got back here with someone not so darned picky. We split 2 pupusas (meat & cheese), a burrito supreme and a torta.

The pupusa's were good but I feel like we got a bean and a cheese instead of a meat and a cheese. Either way they were yummy.

The burrito was awesome and huge. The torta was good but didn't meld it's flavors as well as other places. Not that it was bad, just that I've had better. The torta came with fries.

Still haven't tried the alcoholic drinks here. Usually up here for workshops in the area which don't lend themselves to alcoholic beverages (need focus!).

The waitstaff is friendly and service is decent. Prices are good This place makes my short list for any Allston trips.
