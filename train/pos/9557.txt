Don't you just hate that person who talks about how much they LOVE a place but cannot name one thing they had?  That's about to be me.

Not because I've forgotten what we ate (sure, I can remember every bite I've taken in the last 10 years, but I can't seem to remember things I put on my to-do list this morning), but because most of it was unrecognizably-named, even by well-traveled, well-fed food people standards.  I will do my best to recite/describe our dishes, but suffice it to say that this place is cheap, clean, and delicious, so you really can't go wrong with any dish - we certainly didn't!

We obviously started our meal with a couple rounds of pisco sours.  One of my dining companions swears it's the best she's had on this continent, so we obviously needed to partake.  I cannot comment on its relative goodness compared with others of its kind, but it was smooth, silky, and strong, if that does anything for ya.  They went down scary-smoothly, so thank goodness the food started coming out of the kitchen to slow our drink-pace.

As I said, everything was absolutely delicious and extremely cheap.  

Empanadas were flaky, buttery, and soft.  

The papa rellena was crispy on the outside, yet silky on the inside.  

Ceviche de pescado was crisp, cool, and fresh, with not even a hint of fishiness.

As it was a cold day, we ordered some Tacu tacu to warm our core after the cool ceviche.  Our offering came with seafood and was served steaming hot.  The dish was hearty and salty, but not overwhelmingly so.  The portion is large and, with our other dishes, the three of us barely made a dent in this.  

You could basically close your eyes and point out your order - leave it to the gods of randomness - because everything we had was beautifully executed and delicious.

Advice:  don't just stick with what's familiar - order something you can't even pronounce and you will not be disappointed.
