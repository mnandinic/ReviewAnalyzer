man oh man.
two things:
1) oxtail: succulent umami heaven.  sucking on the bones is almost as good as the meat itself.
2) goat: perfectly seasoned.
not for nothing, but i'd give my right pinkie for their beans recipe, too.  don't know what they put in there, but it's akin to, i don't know, nirvana.
it's one of those places, like redbones, where i always get the same thing and am always happy with my decision to do so (why fix it if it ain't broke, right?), so ox and goat is where my expertise stops - but those two things are, by far, the best in JP.  
the fried sweet plantains also rock my world.
go for the takeout - there is no atmosphere to speak of, except for the super-ancient random sports memorabilia.  on the other hand, the cuban geriatrics sitting around def. liven up the place.  seriously,  they are a fun-lovin' bunch!
dinner for one hovers around $10.
