Last Sunday was my third time at Merengue Restaurant.  We live an hour away from this Restaurant but it's worth the ride.  
Once you step in the restaurant you forget what part of town you just parked your car.  The vibe, the people and the food smell takes you on a journey of relaxation.
The food has never disappointed us, everything is fresh and almost feels like your "abuelita" is cooking in the back as they never stop bringing the authentic -old school flavor to every single dish.
I am not Dominican but I have eaten in other Caribbean restaurants and no one cooks like Merengue.!!
