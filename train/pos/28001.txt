Love this place! Everything in their menu is delicious, full of flavors, at a great price!I discovered this place 5 years ago when a friend took me for lunch, and since then it's become one of my favorite restaurants.I love their chicken burritos, tacos with their delicious home made hot sauce (a bit spicy), pupusas, and their Camarones a la Diablas! For those that love hot sauce, this is the dish to try!The staff and owners are also very nice. The owner is usually at the restaurant talking his time asking his guests how their meal is. Very nice guy he is, and I like his friendly gesture. It shows that he cares for his restaurant/guests. I believe that's part of why Mi Pueblito is successful!Check it out!!!
