A co worker raved about La Casa De Pedro.  So I had to try it.  A friend of mine and I went for Dinner last Friday . June 19th. Now I can't stop raving about it! What a wonderful Restaurant.....We were given the option of having Dinner inside or outside.  We opted for inside because I wanted to see what the Restaurant looked like.  Nice atmosphere inside with a lot of comfortable booths. We ordered drinks.  I had a Fruity Martini. My friend, had a Maitai. We both enjoyed our drinks.   They don't skimp on the Alcohol.  Not too strong, just right!  The food was wonderful!  I ordered the Salmon. I  have never had Salmon prepared like that!  Huge portions, The Salmon served on a bed of black Beans,  Salmon covered in Red , Green peppers and onions and Shrimp!  with a side of Rice and sweet Plantains and Yuca..... Unbelievable Flavor!   The servers were very attentive.  We thought that the alcohol was a little expensive.  But the food prices were  reasonable.  I will definitely return!!!
