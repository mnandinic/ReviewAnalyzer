I've only gotten takeout from here since it's close to work - which makes the prospect of going here all the more enticing!  The food is almost too good.  The guys at work order the baked or fried fish with tons of lime and rice and beans.  I get the Mixed Burrito and the Chicken Nachos.  All of which can put you into a food coma.  Before I used to go to either pizza or the local chinese food place, but I think I've found a new place for when everyone is ordering.I've also had some of the Beef, Chicken, and Shrimp Fajita's that someone couldn't finish.  I could barely finish their leftovers!  It's so much food and it's so damn delicious.I can't wait to finally go here and enjoy their service instead of just their food.
