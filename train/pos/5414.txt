 had a really delicious meal at Merengue. I ordered Mofongo de Pollo (bomb), Mondongo (I will probably come back and order this once a week) and one of the best cappuccinos I've ever tasted. Nancy, my server, was courteous, polite, and patient as I navigated the menu with my broken Spanish.

All in all, I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it. I walked by it yesterday (Saturday) around lunchtime and the place was packed!
