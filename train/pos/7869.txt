I was in the mood for something appetizing and full of culture. On my way driving home on a gorgeous Saturday I remembered that Izzy's was on the next corner so my mom & I decided to stop in and grab lunch.

We got the fish & shrimp combo, which came with beans and rice & I added a fishcake. The fishcake was a bit on the salty side but still delicious.

Very tasty food.
