Legit!  This place is the real deal.  Among the best dinners I've had, ever.  We've had fresh ceviche from vendors on the side of the beach in Ecuador (amazing!), from gourmet, high-end restaurants (just OK). this was absolutely just as good... if not better.  

We had the Shrimp Ceviche... to die for, and the seafood Tacu Tacu.   It was offensively delicious.  I feel like my taste buds were assaulted. My palette was seduced, transported to South America and left in a hammock, in a food coma.  OMG!
