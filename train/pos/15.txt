I ordered food from Mi Pueblito for an event at my school and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved the food! The carne asada was flavorful, juicy and tender and the pupusas were delicious and authentic! They were incredibly accommodating and delivered to campus.I will definitely be ordering from here again!
