Love their food if you want some good dominican food you must come here.  The king fish with coconut sauce and white rice is the bomb.  They also have good mofongo.  The wait staff is super friendly.  Great or family or friends or to have a small birthday gathering I love this spot despite the area and reputation of city !!!
