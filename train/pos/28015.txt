my wife and i went to san juan last year and this place gives them a run for the money... actually the sweet plantains are better here, so food A+++our waiter (joel???) was truly unbelievable and don't understand why the management would have him working with two recent hires and a tuesday before new years which we all know gets crazy (luckily we made reservations as the place was mobbed). this guy was extremely personable, joked around with all the people and most surprisingly the food was coming out rather fast given the short staff and place being mobbed. at one point my wife pointed out that he was also making drinks... wow!overall A+++ although make reservations to play it safe
