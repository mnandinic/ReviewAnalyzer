I was getting a haircut nearby and had just enough time to stop by for a quick meal.  I got a combination plate that consisted of a pollo asado taco, a pupusa, and an enchilada. Everything was pretty on point.  I wouldn't say it's the best i've had on the East Coast but it ranks above average for sure.

Unfortunately, I couldn't get a picture because my hunger got the best of me....whoops.  

Food took about 25 minutes, and chips + salsa were free if dining in.

The place is modest and cozy.  Can definitely use an interior upgrade but who cares if they serve good food right???
