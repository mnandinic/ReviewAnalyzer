I bought a Groupon to Merengue awhile back (when I was new to Groupon and a little overzealous with my purchasing). It was about to expire, and although my boyfriend and I were a little skeptical (as we'd never had Dominican food) we decided to try it Sunday night.

Driving there was a little sketchy, through some bad neighborhoods, but the restaurant itself is on a (safer-looking) main street.

But the food was delicious!! We had the Dominican salami and fried cheese to start, on the recommendation of some of these fellow yelpers, and it was SO GOOD. For my meal I had Chicharrón de Pollo (Fried Breaded Chicken Chunks) and my boyfriend had Bistec Merengue (Thin Cut Marinated Steak, Sauteé with Green Peppers, Red Peppers and Onion). We were very satisfied with the experience, and would definitely recommend it to others!

Oh! and the margaritas were excellent!
