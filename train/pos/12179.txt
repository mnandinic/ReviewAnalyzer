my boyfriend requests going here at least once a week. good for lunch and dinner if you're looking for a very cheap eat but also wonderful mexican food. i always get the chicken flautas or the enchiladas verdes. my boyfriend gets the pork burrito supreme EVERY TIME. also, we always leave room to share a piece of tres leches cake. i cannot recommend  the aforementioned dishes more highly. best mexican food in boston! additionally, the waitresses are super sweet and think it's hilarious how often we come in to stuff our faces. not embarrassed!
