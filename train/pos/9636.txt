I am SO sorry for giving this restaurant a 4 star!! I looked back and thought why?? I have to give this place 5 stars. I went back today with my boyfriend and we fell in love all over again. The waitresses are sooooo friendly there, the food is out of this world and it's priced very well. We were sort of confused how to eat the leche de tigre, but it was so delicious. It packs a mighty punch!

We got the Tacu Tacu, again, and the Pescado a lo Macho. Both words can't express. The sauces for both of these dishes are heavenly! We also got the sangria and Maracuya sour drinks and those were very good as well; very generous with the liquor, too ;-)

This is THE place for Peruvian food. We will always come back!
