I only noticed this place yesterday and got so excited about eating here that I took my coworkers to lunch here today. The inside of the restaurant has ample seating, and the waitress was very friendly even though she didn't speak very much English.

We ordered two Mexican Combination plates and one Columbian Typical Plate. The Mexican plate consisted of an incredibly delicious chile relleno unlike any I have ever eaten: it was almost like a beef stew inside a chile. It was so great that even though I finished eating 30 minutes ago, I want to go back and eat another right now. The Mexican plate also had a flauta in which the chicken therein was sadly a little dry from the flauta being deep fried for a bit too long. There was also an enchilada and a really tasty salad with guac and a huge portion of rice and beans. This is a LOT of food for $10.

The Columbian plate was just as good but a lot more interesting. It had chicharron (pig skin with some pork attached to it), a really tasty steak, a fried egg, fried ripe plantains, beans, rice, and salad. Hard to go wrong with a combo like that.

I was not expecting to be nearly this impressed with this restaurant. I will be coming back and bringing as many of my friends as possible.
