EXTRA, EXTRA: A Dominican guy wants to share his opinion about the best known Dominican restaurant in Greater Boston! He thinks that this place rocks, even in comparison to criollo restaurants you will find in the DR.

For real! Let's start with the experience of getting into the restaurant. You are welcome by walls painted with an explosion of warm, vivacious colors which immediately make you feel at home, a necessary condition if you want to imitate Dominican hospitality. On the walls too, there are paintings glorifying some of the produce most represented in our cuisine. Overall, the venue has a rustic, woody feel to it that gives the restaurant an aura of authenticity.

You have beautiful and friendly waitresses very knowledgeable about the menu and who seem to believe it is their duty to bring a smile to your face. The waiting time for any given dish is low, and you would have most of any item on the menu served, except for the ever famous sancocho, which because of its high demand may be over by the time you get there.

I've had so many dishes at this place that I won't talk about anyone in particular, but just say that they are consistently cooked excellently well. Add to that very reasonable prices, and you will feel more than happy to give an extra generous tip to the waitress!
