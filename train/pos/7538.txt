Fantastic meal. My friend ordered the Carne Asada with sweet plantains and black beans; I ordered the steak Chimichanga Meal with the same sides (choice of two sides includes rice, beans [red or black], fried plantains, sweet plantains, fries, salad, or veggies - nice selection). The carne asada was tender, cooked perfectly with a lemon-lime chimichurri sauce which we both thought extremely unique and refreshing. The chimichanga was generously stuffed, crisp but not greasy, and the salsa verde and avocado topping were fabulous.  The plantains were tender, flavorful, and also not at all greasy; the black beans were served warm in their own little dish, like a little bowl of soup. Service here was excellent and very friendly, and prices reasonable.
