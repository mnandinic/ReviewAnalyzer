I made a reservation for Saturday night for 7:30pm and we were taken right to our table on a very rainy night.  We ordered the drinks which were very tasty, I had black rasberry margarita, yummy and my gf ordered the Jalapeno margarita, which had such an amazing tasty kick.  We ordered some tapas, the mago ceviche which was fresh and tasty as well as the queso fondida.  I was truly in food heaven, what a great assortment of food was on the menu.  

For dinner, I ordered the Osso buco which was fall of the bone tastiness.  My girlfriend ordered the special, a beautifully cooked trout stuffed with lobster and crab.  This dish definitely stole the show and I couldn't get enough of it.  

For dessert, I ordered the coconut flan that was incredibly tasty.

It was great because Pedro greeted most people at the door and walked around during the meal to make sure everything was ok.

The atmosphere almost feels like you're in Cuba or some tropical island.  It was colorful with palm trees.  The only thing missing was parrots or birds flying around.

I was very impressed, we brought a friend here from NYC and she was very impressed with the food and atmosphere.  I'd definitely come back.  Oh Pedro, with food this tasty, how can I not get fat?
