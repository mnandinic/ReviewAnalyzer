This place is fantastic.  I had a groupon, $25 for $50 worth of food. Now at most restaurants its usually pretty easy to spend that much on 2 people but this place was cheap and the portions were huge.  Started the meal w a sangria while my gf had a glass of cab.  Wine is only $5 a glass but the sangria tasted like it was just made rather than the previous day, it just hadn't had a chance to come together. The mussels in creole sauce were great.  i had never seen mussels this big in my life and the creole sauce was delicious. I just wish i had some bread to soak it up with. The only downside was the mussels were not debearded all that well. We read on their website that phatom gourmet loves the mofongos so we had to try that. We got the chicken mofongos which were a little bland. The grilled snapper w garlic and parsley sauce was not bland at all. It was fantastic and cooked perfectly. I got this with sweet plantains cooked perfectly as well. We got the beef merengue which was very tasty but perhaps a tad overcooked. For dessert we had the flan which had a chocolate sauce which was a nice new twist for me. The best part of this place though is the atmosphere. Decorated in bright and vibrant colors w very cool art everywhere. They even had a Dominican performer playing live authentic music! With great service, very good food, and huge portions at not much cost, you have to go here. It may not be in the greatest part of Boston but its worth the trip.
