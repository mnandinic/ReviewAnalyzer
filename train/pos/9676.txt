I do not write reviews, but this excellent restaurant deserves one.

I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant. If you are looking for authentic Peruvian food, you need to try the dishes here. I always go for the popular plates, Lomo Saltado, Ceviche, and Causa Rellena and I have always been satisfied with my food and crave more. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive. I have probably been more than a dozen times and I would choose this restaurant over other Peruvian restaurants that have average food.

If you want authentic, delicious, and very affordable Peruvian cuisine, you need to come to this East Boston jewel.
