Four stars and rising...

This review is for eat-in, as takeout is currently unavailable for the next couple of weeks. The owner encouraged me to come in for dinner, though, and I'm glad I did.

I had the Sea Breeze burrito, packed with seafood (lobster, clams, some other goodness I can't quite remember), and it was fantastic. The partner had the Chimichanga, also well made and well-received.

They have two types of salsas, which you can ask for when they bring you the tortilla chips to munch while you wait for your food. Opt for the hot stuff--it's spicy and good.

Then, our server asked us if we wanted to try cocopaya (sp?) for dessert: coconut flakes with papaya and honey. OMG. YES, PLEASE!

Two entrees and dessert cost us a total of $40 (including tip). The prices are a bit high, I'd say, but I wasn't disappointed, and I'll come back again, most probably for takeout, but the dining experience was so pleasant, I'll most likely sit down and enjoy, too.
