Ive been eating here since i was a child! 23 years of delicious Puerto Rican food. I love everything on the menu. from skirt steak, Jamaican parties, rice & beans, and stew chicken. they have become a cambridge staple. I love to see a wide variety of ethic groups enjoying the good food and atmosphere. The staff treats everyone like family. I love walking through the door and hearing the familiar "hola prima".
