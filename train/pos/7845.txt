Yay for Izzy! I'm  Puerto Rican and I've been in Boston now for 4 years.  For some reason I never heard about his place until today.  I've been to Veijigantes (which is fun for groups but the food is not great) and Oriental de Cuba (I'm a fan).  Izzy's definitely has that Puerto Rican ambiance that I love.  I went for the oxtail but they were out of it so I got the goat stew with rice, beans and sweet plantains.  It definitely hit the spot and I left very satisfied.  I'm coming back!  Oh, and the owners were super friendly and chatted with me while rested after eating.
