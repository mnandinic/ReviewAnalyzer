Fantastic Venezuelan food and South American cocktails.We got the plantains with queso and the BBQ back ribs as starters and the churrasco steak and the lamp chops for a main. Also the Venezuelan flan for dessert and a Caipirinha and a Passion Fruit Margarita for drinks. Everything was exquisite. Nice, romantic atmosphere too. We will definitely come here again.Only criticism would be that the space is extremely tightly packed -- They had to move the table for us to get in!
