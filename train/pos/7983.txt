I understand that the food in Puerto Rico is hard to replicate and your mommy and auntie make way better rice and beans then Izzy's does, but I highly doubt you'll be inviting me over for dinner with the fam and I'm pretty sure we're not in FUCKING San Juan.
So please give the people at Izzy's some credit for trying to bring a little bit of love back from PR.
I've had the chicken and cheese's, they're incredible! I've also had the beef patties, fried pork sub and the rice and beans with grilled chicken. I don't go here a lot but every time I go I leave completely satisfied.
