This place is the best! I'm comfortable saying I'm a food snob, but this place never disappoints. I usually order the Plato Monta√±ero and a few empanadas, and the quality has been excellent every time. I have tried several other menu items as well, and I have been impressed with everything I have eaten here. Every time someone visits from out of town this is the first place we take them, and it gets rave reviews all around. They can expect to see me there regularly.
