This is near my corporate office and I forgot about it until my manager took me there for lunch this past week.  I had the fish tacos and they were amazing. Served with fried plantains and a black bean rice. The server was attentive and we were able to get served within our lunch time. I went here 2 years ago for dinner but cannot recall what I ordered but I do remember the person I was with and I really loved the food.

Next time I am in MA I will definitely go here again.
