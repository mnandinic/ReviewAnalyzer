my girlfriend and the couple with whom we were meeting were a little skeptical as we approached Rincon Limeno; it was an unfamiliar neighborhood.  the decor seemed a little stark, but we ventured in after having read the yelp reviews.  a few of us don't eat meat or shell fish and thought we might have difficulties, but every dish we ordered was incredibly good.  the appetizers and the main courses.  we were able to get ceviche without shellfish and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  i'm giving it 5 stars because the food was so good.
