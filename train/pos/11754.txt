Sure, it's not in Allston Village, so you have to trek the few blocks down Brighton Ave for this Mexican/Guatemalan joint, but it is definitely worth it.

Prices are cheap and the food is good and filling, without making you feel like a bloated whale. I got the enchiladas verde and the sangria, both of which I would recommend.

Can't wait to go back and do a little barhop: Deep Ellum-Model-Sillhouette.

Mas, por favor.
