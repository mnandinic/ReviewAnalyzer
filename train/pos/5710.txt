I like this little spot! Always end up getting the Garlic chicken breast w/ yellow rice & sweet plaintain. Oh yea with a strawberry smoothie! Not too expensive either full circle pan of rice, nice big chicken breast, full box of plaintain with a side salad for like 14/15 bucks! Can't beat that! Nice spot for when you want something other than pizza, subs & chinese *blah
