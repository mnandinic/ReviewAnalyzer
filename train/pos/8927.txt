Ate here recently with friends and it was delicious! We shared 3 main dishes among 4 adults, and it was plenty of food: one of the fish ceviches, tacu tacu (served in what seems like a mild curry sauce), and cau cau (beef tripe), Friendly service. For dessert we tried the alfajores Peruvian style (very nice, flaky/powdery) and the flan. Would definitely visit again. Walked here from the T station and it was do-able, less than 10 minutes.
