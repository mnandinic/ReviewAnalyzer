Grabbed lunch here with coworkers--excellent choice for grab'n'go as you can do so in under 5 minutes. I tried the chicken combo which allowed me to choose from 2 curries and it came with flurry basmati rice, naan and I added a veggie samosa. The chicken tikka masala was great with a nice level of spice and the aloo gobi was delicious with tender potatoes and cauliflower cooked in lots of aromatics and a rich curry sauce with onions. The naan was a miss for me as it felt more like a flat pancake type bread and wasn't bubbly and crisp like naan usually is. The veggie samosa was superb with smashed potatoes and peas and spicy! The combo is a lot of food and I didn't finish it but it is nice to have so much variety on the plate. Would gladly return!
