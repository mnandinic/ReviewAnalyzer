I come to this restaurant often and I haven't had a bad experience yet! There drinks are great and the food is even better. My usual is the churrasco with chimichurri sauce with malanga...my mouth is watering just writing this.  My favorite apps are their surillitos and the crab meat on the fried plantains. Their tamarind maritini is incredible. I have had many items on their menu and it is all good!!
