I think this place is great! It's right near my office so its a good lunch option. Definitely a casual, take-out place and for what it is, it is very good.

I had two vegetarian dishes and I enjoyed them both. They were very flavorful but not too (hot) spicy. I love that they have lots of vegetarian (and vegan) options and that they are clearly labeled as such.

In my opinion, they give you a LOT of food. I didnt think I would finish the two curries with all the rice but I did because it was so delicious... and I guess I'm a fatty. I will agree that the naan is a bit lacking, but honestly I didnt even need to eat it because there was so much else. I think rice + naan is a bit excessive, no?

I will definitely be coming back and I can't wait to try more dishes. Also, another thing was that they were very friendly, which is always nice. The server was very patient even though I was indecicive and was like "I'll have the dal, no the potato... no wait actually yes the dal."

Will lapse into a food coma now :)
