As a non-fan of Latin American cuisine, I have to say the food here was delicious and inexpensive.  It's definitely worth going if you like Mexican / Guatemalan / El Salvadoran food.

Foods I tried included the pupusas -- while good -- which reminded me of chopped Spam / Luncheon meat.  I'm told this meat-filled corn-based tortilla is common in El Salvadore.  The items I really enjoyed included the nachos and the tacos ($2/each), banana shake, side dishes of beans and guacamole.  They also serve a good salsa as a starter with chips.

The tacos -- filled with meat -- were delicious and reminded me of what I'd seen in Mexico as the tortillas used were definitely freshly made.

Overall, service was quick.  The premise is clean and has lots of seating capacity.
