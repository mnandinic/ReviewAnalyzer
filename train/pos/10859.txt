The Tad Show is here every Thursday and at Tad's recommendation we tried Ceviche (Shrimp marinated in fresh lime juice, onions, diced tomatoes and cilantro)  & Pedro's Old Times with Vargas (Pieces of pork tenderloin slightly fried then baked and dressed with hot sauce and the zest of lime juice). Both were delicious, but I was glad of the recommendation as the menu is impressive but slightly daunting. The staff is amazingly helpful and courteous and the management makes every single customer feel like a celebrity. The attention to detail in the kitchen shows in every gorgeous plate they serve. I almost didn't want to take a bite for fear of marring the culinary artistry but after one bite of the yumminess I couldn't resist digging in. I highly recommend checking out La Casa for the delicious food, the wonderful staff and the vibrantly decorated interior.
