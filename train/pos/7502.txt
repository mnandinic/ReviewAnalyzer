The Cantina bowl, the nachos, and the taco salad. The only three items I ever ordered. All delicious and at a great price. Seabreeze is one of my favorite places to eat. The owner and all those who work there, are very nice, and it has a neighborhood feel.  What really sets Seabreeze apart is the quality and freshness of the food. If I ordered a Cantina bowl with extra Guac to go, they would wait until I got there to add the extra Guac. And if you ever have the chance to eat in, you'll see how much attention to detail their is in building your dish. The owner has what I consider to be food OCD. He treats your plate like an art piece. And I can't forget to mention that the whole place is incredibly clean. Look back at the kitchen when you order. It's in perfect order. Wish there was a Seabreeze in Providence.  Go to this place!
