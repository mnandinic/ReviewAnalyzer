After years of hearing about this place, I finally made it out, with the encouragement from the gf and a Groupon! For a person who considers himself a huge fan of latin food, I'm a little ashamed for not trying this place out sooner, but it's okay probably saved myself from all the extra LBS! First off, I don't see why a Groupon is even offered, when the prices are ridiculously cheap to begin with and it sure didn't look like they had a shortage of customers either. Anyways, we ordered the fried cheese and salami (very good and should be a must try), ceviche (not too sour, but had overcooked shrimp), mussels (big and flavorful, but once again overcooked), a side of yellow rice and beans, tostones (fried plantains, not overly greasy, yet still crispy), chicken mofongo w/chicken broth (mashed plantains w/shredded chicken and broth dipping sauce, pretty good), and a seafood paella (sauce and rice was very flavorful, but once again all the seafood was way overcooked). Everything was very good and portions are large. There wasn't much of a wait for the food to come out and only the complaint is the lack seafood in the paella even though it was overcooked, but not enough to ruin the entire dish for me. Must try the guava smoothie and the fried cheese! Trust I will be returning and ohh yeah for the 2 of us pretty much finished all that!
