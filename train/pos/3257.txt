This place is bad ass. Great atmosphere, great margaritas, incredible food. Totally legit, and we should know, because we've gone on vacation in Latin American countries that are sortof near the Dominican Republic. And besides, I happen to be a fan of Pedro Martinez. So we're pretty much honorary Dominicans.

I got the whole red snapper because Always Pick Whole Fish - that's a life lesson that I'm giving to you for free - and of course it was kickass. Creole sauce won. Ceviche, made with lemon - I use lime myself, but lemon is legit too - very tasty.

We both felt that some more spice wouldn't have been out of place. And the hot sauce on our table was bullshit so we couldn't just slop it on everything. But still: we're totally coming back here. And this time I'm getting shitfaced on those margaritas, because it's like two turns driving back home. I could have done that way drunker.
