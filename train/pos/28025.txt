An incredible blend of Italian and Peruvian cuisine gives Taranta's food a spicy kick! The Pisco Sours were the best and strongest I have had outside of Peru, and the Causa de Cangrejo made me nostalgic of my time in Latin America.We ordered two pasta dishes - the fusili and the orecchiette. Both were very big portions that came with an exotic flavor not normally found in Italian cuisine! The wait staff was very knowledgeable about all of the food items, what levels of spiciness we wanted and which items to recommend for us!Come here if you want a different taste of the North End - one that is certainly spicier and with a great view of the Financial District in front of the restaurant!
