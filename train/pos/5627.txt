Wow! I am amazed at the superior quality of the chicken! I normally have absolutely no interest in chicken, finding it generally bland and chewy, but this place knows something most other restaurants don't. The chicken was not only delicious but excellently seasoned. I also sampled some plantains and rice. Delish! I am not in the area frequently, but will definitely stop in again.
