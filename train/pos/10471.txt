Fantastic service - quick and friendly - and the food was top-notch. There are plenty of Indian restaurants along Mass Ave, but this is not only more reasonably priced than most, the food is terrific. I got the chicken korma, and it was well-spiced, juicy, and appropriately sauced. All this plus free WiFi?! YES.
