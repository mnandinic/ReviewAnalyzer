I went for dinner with a group and friends and had a wonderful experience. I ordered the special which was a filet of red snapper with shrimp, oysters and clams. It was delicious!!! Our table shared a couple Arepas along with the Camarones al Ajillo as appetizers and they were all very tasty as well.

The only negative was that my friend found something in her food. Normally this would lower my rating, but the chef personally came out to explain what happened and apologize. We were not charged for that dish and we given a few varieties of flan to try on the house. The traditional and coconut were excellent.

We'll definitely be coming back soon!
