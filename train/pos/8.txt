I wish I were kidding when I say: poems should be written about their mojo and hot sauce. To quote Don Juan De Marco (yes) these two sauces "inspire me to love." I know it sounds absurd, but trust me.When I come, I usually order an arepa and rice, beans and yuca for the table. The datiles are also really awesome if you eat bacon. Note that the beans are cooked with pork.I recommend coming for lunch (and check their hours before you head here- I've come on a Monday before to find them closed). Dinner hours can be intensely busy, which can be fun, but I also enjoy how fast I can get my food and how much more mellow the atmosphere is during lunch. The wait staff has also generally been kind and helpful.Also, expresso. Try it.
