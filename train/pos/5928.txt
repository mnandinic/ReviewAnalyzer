I have only eaten here once but it definitely won't be my last. Friends and I visited recently for dinner and the restaurant was busy but we did not feel rushed. We ordered appetizers that were fresh and large in portion size. I had the berejena asado with tostones and my friends had the meat sampler and pastilitos.

For dinner I had camarones with aroz con habichuelas and maduros, which was white rice, a side of beans and shrimp in a red creole sauce. The portion size was large and the dish very flavorful. My friends had a salmon plate and a chicken plate and both gave good reviews for flavor. One suggestion was to include a sauce on the side for the fried chicken plate as the meat and rice were a tad bit dry. We did not have room for dessert!
