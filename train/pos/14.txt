If you are craving an authentic Central American meal: breakfast, lunch, or dinner....this is a great place!!  The food is for real!! Clean, good food, great ambiance!! They give you all of those little extras; cheese, crema, tortillas de ma√≠z. Don't come looking for 5 star elegance. But if you want an authentic experience, this is the place! Worth the trip to Eastie.
