Really good and really fresh!

It started with us being offered yummy fresh tortilla chips and delicious salsa on the house.

I had to get the jugo de Marañón, a delicious, refreshing juice made from cashew fruit.  It was yummy and not too sweet and tasted vaguely of pineapple.  I had to protect it from my boyfriend and my friend.

We got two pupusas, the loroco and the pork and cheese.  They cam out quickly and were super delicious, moist and perfectly cooked.

I ordered the taco sampler and was so happy with my choice, especially for $9.99.  The tacos are simple, just meat and onions, perfectly ripe avocado and lime wedges and each is wrapped with two super fresh and delicious homemade corn tortillas.  I asked for no cilantro, I wish I liked it, but it just tastes like soap to me.  There was also a plentiful serving of rice and beans, really flavorful and yummy hot sauce, I mean HOTT sauce.

The bf got a yummy chile rellenos.  It was one huge pepper stuffed with beef and fried and topped with a yummy sauce.  The beef was definitely more like a stew as others have noted.  It also came with a generous helping of rice and beans.

Our friend got the enchiladas verdes which were super yummy.  The fresh tortillas really make a difference and the salsa verde was great.  The dish came with the rice and beans, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.

We will definitely be back.

Service was kind and attentive.  Prices are really reasonable too!
