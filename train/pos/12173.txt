I've been coming here since they opened the place, since then the place is getting better and better. I can see how the business has grown in clientele. Customers used to be only latin people, but nowadays I see how there is a variety of also american people.

Food is great: pupusas revueltas, tamales de pollo, tacos de res,  churrasco, camarones rebozados, pollo campero and so other dishes from the menu. But that's most likely what I usually order. And their dessert: Tres Leches is great. I love it!!!
Price is affordable, not pricey. And you get a good quantity plus its quality. Yeah!!!

Staff is nice. Though, usually every 6-7 months or less you will see different waitress. The best one is Ingrid. She's being working there for more than 2 years and her service is great. She always bring you a nice smile to the table.

And of course, as most of the places I look for, this is a good place where I can spend alone. Just me, my food and my beer. And Yeah! sometimes my computer and/or sketchbook.

They play latin music, and if you like so. Music is not bad.

I recommend this place for all type of groups of people: families, coworkers, friends, couples and just one person alone.

Note: If you look for a full bar, they don't. They do have margaritas, but last time my friend said that it was too sweet and not that great for a full bar person.
