Delicious and very inexpensive. I had the Puerto Rican Rice, steak and plantains. The empanadas were just ok. The spicy margaritas are the price of most meals but so fresh they're worth it. The ambiance is really fun but I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a quiet or private evening. Also, it's in the south end so you can walk to bars after if you're into that.
