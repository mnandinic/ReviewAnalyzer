My boyfriend and I hit this spot probably once a week--really high quality and great prices!  The Naanz sandwiches are absolutely excellent.  He loves the Tikka Masala.  Always friendly, welcoming, and very inviting if you're getting to-go or eating in the restaurant.  Garlic Naan worth it on its own!
