LOVED LOVED everything about  Casa de Pedro. Had reservations and were sat immediately.  Conscientious staff. Fabulous ceviche, chorizo and salmon dish. We had numerous dishes but I personally loved  these. We were there on a Saturday 6:30 to almost 9 pm. Enjoyed not only the fabulous food but also the ambience which included live music!
