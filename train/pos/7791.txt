The moment I walked into Izzy's, I knew I would be in for a delicious meal. This small, unassuming restaurant is a little off the beaten path, but those who find it will not be disappointed. The patrons were primarily Spanish-speaking, which I took to be a very good sign of the food's authenticity. Pictures of the dishes along the walls did not help my grumbling belly as I waited for my food to arrive. I ordered the stewed goat with yellow rice (a Friday special), which came with red beans and a side salad. The portions were generous but not overwhelming. The meat and side dishes were all perfectly seasoned. Salt and pepper unneeded. Service was quick and the staff friendly.

It seems there's a new hip restaurant cropping up every week in the nearby Kendall Square area, so it's especially nice to see a down-to-earth place like Izzy's get props. This place won't score points for ambience, but the food will keep me coming back. Next up: Oxtail!
