This place is really, really good. The prices are decent, and the food is as good as you can get in the area for Latin American food. I'm sad that I didn't eat here until my last week in Boston. It's unfortunately a little inconvenient to get to El Carrizal if you're too lazy to walk from the Harvard or Packards Corner T stops, but the 66, 57, and 64 buses all stop nearby.

Anyway, the pupusas are the best I've had in recent memory, and the Salvadorean plate with its tamale was ridiculously good. My girlfriend got the taco salad (not the best choice if you want "authentic"), which was freaking enormous. Service was very friendly, nice, and fast, and I'd like to point out that they're completely fluent in English. I don't know what Allix T. was talking about. The menu was in English for God's sakes. Of course, if you want to speak Spanish, I'm sure they'd be more than happy. The table next to us ordered from the waitress in rather fast Mexican Spanish. However, I'm perfectly happy to speak English unless I'm annoyed and want to curse them in their native tongue, which was absolutely not necessary. (Yes, I claim to be fluent.) Get the horchata, and if you could, please let me know how the marañón is, as they were out when I went.

Oh, one disappointment is they never delivered our plate of plantains, so I'm taking off a star for that. They didn't charge us for it, though (at least I hope not; I didn't really look closely at the bill), so I didn't really care. I was really full anyway. Having a plate of plantains would've just fattened us up even more.
