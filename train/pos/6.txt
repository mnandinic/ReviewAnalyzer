Love this place for lunch Venezuelan flava is the way to go especially when your sick or the norm for you South End workers.  It's a quaint place to get a great bite to eat and fast.  Get an empanada to an arepa sandwich or entire meal.  Man love bacon wrapped dates w almonds.  Service is fast and they have great personality.  I've been here twice and not a  disappointment.  Come after work and get a drink. Only thing is they have set time for lunch hours and open back up 6pn for dinner
