Are you from SoCal and miss the authentic, simple tacos that only have meat, onions, cilantro and hot sauce? I am and did, until I found this place.

Highlights:

1) Get the tacos. Amazing. Simple. Unadulterated. Delicious. Pork ones are the best in my opinion. Chicken is a little dry, but the steak ones are also very good.

2) Hot sauce accompanying the tacos is superb.

3) You're first greeted with crispy tortilla chips with just the right amount of salt coupled with their homemade, delicious salsa.

4) Because of the authenticity of this place, the waitstaff isn't very good at social skills when dealing with an English party. Prepare to speak very clearly and try to not complicate your order - unless you speak Spanish of course!

5) Atmosphere is surprisingly very nice and clean. They have a TV usually playing some futbol (soccer).

6) I wouldn't recommend for groups because I believe they only have one cook most of the times. I just went this evening (my fifth time there), and it was just me and a friend and it took about 15 minutes for both our meals when there was only one other table there so I'm assuming a larger party would take quite some time.

7) Nice selection of beers such as Modelo, Modelo dark, etc.

8) Very fresh and yummy margaritas. They literally have one blender and make it like at the counter for you - haha. Delicious though.

Overall, very pleased with this place. It's a great taste of unadulterated California tacos that I simply have not found anywhere in Boston. Definitely worth a try. Plus, it's very affordable especially for a decent sit-down with fresh food!
