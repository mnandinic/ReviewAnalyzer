awesome!  S's friend L took us there today for our introduction to Peruvian food.   We couldnt get over the generous servings of FRESH seafood.   We were nuts about the Tacu Tacu:  mounds of fresh seafood in a savory "aji amarillo" sauce, served on a plate of rice and beans was out of this world.   Ceviche was crazy good with more fresh seafood and just enough lime juice and spices.  Fried snapper was fresh and delicious as ware the churos a la chalaca.   Oh, and then there was the chicha mirada which was so refreshing.  Great prices, welcoming service,  nice ambience.   We'll be back here again soon.
