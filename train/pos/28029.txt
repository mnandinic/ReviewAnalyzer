Serious yum!  Very delicious meal.  Husband had beef, I had salmon...both equally delicious. My 7 year old had fettucini alfredo and practically licked the plate.  OK on service and kind of tight quarters but you expect that in the North End. If I could give 4 1/2 I would just based on the room and service but the food is awesome!
