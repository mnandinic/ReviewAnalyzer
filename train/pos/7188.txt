Under new management, and a new chef. The food was fabulous, and they were incredibly accommodating of two vegetarians and two celiac/gluten free diners, and made fantastic recommendations, and accommodations.

The ambiance is clean, and nautical. But the food is brilliant. The house made hot sauce is FABULOUS. (I took the remainder of mine home with me in a take out cup.

HIGHLY reccomended!
