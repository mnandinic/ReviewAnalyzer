What a gem!  Chicharron were amazing.  Service was very friendly and accommodating.  A little tight on the seating, but I didn't mind! Excellent value as well.  We had empanadas, ceviche, cod fritters and the chicharron with maduros.  Kids don't have to be too adventurous of eaters in order to enjoy.  And there was free valet!  So valuable in that area!  Can't wait to go back.
