Fantastic! The service (bonus if you or someone in your party speaks Spanish), atmosphere, and ambiance was all on point. I don't normally venture into East Boston, but this is definitely worth it.

The choros a la chalaca are the best mussels I've ever had. Very tangy due to the lime and just the right amount of heat. I could order two plates of that and call it a night. Severe onion breath though.

I chose the Lomo Saltado as the main dish, which was pretty good. The meat was a little tough and drier than my liking, and the fries were too soggy. The Ceviche de Pescado is awesome and a bit on the salty side.

Next time, I definitely want to try the Tacu Tacu seafood, Paella Peruviana, and purple corn pudding for dessert :)

Oh and their Sangria is solid. Naughty stuff...
