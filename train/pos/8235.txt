As authentic as it gets in Cambridge. This puertorican restaurant will have you believing you're back at the island. Highly recommend any meat (pollo guizado is my favorite) with white rice and beans, accompanied with some tostones. Pernil is also delicious, as is the mondongo and asopao soups. Service is outstanding; the family that runs the restaurant is very welcoming.
