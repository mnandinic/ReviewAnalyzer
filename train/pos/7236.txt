The menu had me at mofongo!  I'm a fan of mofongo...it's mashed up fried green plantains, usually plain or mixed with pork and served with some broth to give it moisture.  This place offers mofongo with different protein options (pork, chicken, shrimp, ect.).  I debated whether to go with the shrimp or chicken option - I opted for the latter.

My hubby ordered the carne ascada with rice and beans.  Also, we ordered a chicken empanada and a side order of pan fried sweet plantains...just getting myself to plantain overdose.  

We couldn't figure out if the place is a fast food or dine in (server) type of restaurant.  When we arrived - people were ordering at the counter, paid, grabbed sodas from the beverage case, then sat down and waited for the their food.   We placed our order at the counter but wasn't asked to pay.  So, we grabbed our sodas and sat down.

Think when our food was about ready - the older gentlemen asked if it was to go or for dine in - we said dine in.  He brought silver utensils and brought our meal out in dinnerware.  Guess they are a dine in service establishment.

The chicken wasn't mixed in with the mofongo - but grilled and served with plain mofongo.  It works for me.  The chicken was well seasoned with garlic, pepper, herb and citrus.   The mofongo was huge and tad bit denser than I'm used to but still good. Think the carne ascada was prepped and cooked the same way.  Hubby said the beef was tender and tasty.  Rice was good, too.  The pan fried plantains were a bit oily than I'd like them to be.  Overall, everything was pretty decent.  Ah yes, they forgot the chicken empanada and doubled up on the side of pan fried plantains - which was okay with us.  

Found out the restaurant was under new ownership/management since Jan 2, 2014 - kept the same restaurant name but expanded from the mexican menu.
