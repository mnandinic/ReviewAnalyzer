I have been here 5 times now as i am on a Boston assignment - it is, by far, the best Latin Food in Boston - i say Latin because it offers food from most all Hispan~ola nations. Want Paella? delicious. Want shrimp ceviche? excellent. Want empanadas? so good. Owner/Chef is a gem, and a pro. Stopped by our table multiple visits - check on how food was / service. You cannot go wrong here! Oh yes - try the coconut flan!
