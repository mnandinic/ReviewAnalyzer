Definite hot spot to check out in Roxbury.

Service is pleasant.

Place is decorated with bright and effusive paintings.

Lots of famous celebrities come here and literary people.

It's a very fine Dominican restaurant with an easy but elegant menu.

There are Mexican influences, namely in the desserts.

The food is light, fresh, and excellently spiced.

Not so expensive so it would be good as a date place.
