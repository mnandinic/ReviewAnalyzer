Read some Yelp reviews and decided on Taranta. We were pleased with our choice. Yelp delivers again.We were greeted, seated and ordering in no time. Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable and quickly provided recommendations after a short chat.We took her lead and ordered the Mussels and a Malbec. Excellent. Best mussels I've ever had and I've had many. Don't skip this app and try the Colome Malbec.The other star of the night was the Pork Chop. It is their signature dish for a reason. It's big so you can share some bites. Tender, juicy and cooked perfectly.Everything else was very good. One dish I saw and wish I tried was the Broccoli Rabe and Shrimp.So many dishes, so little time.
