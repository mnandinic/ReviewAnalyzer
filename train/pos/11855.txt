Amazing food for amazing prices. I ate lunch here for just $5! They didn't have any cashew nut juice which I was a little disappointed, but the tongue taco $2.75 and side of beans $2 made up for all of that. Also had a couple of bites of a tamale $2 which was fantastic! I really could taste the corn and freshness. I was so stuffed that I didn't even get a chance to order dessert. Great place to go especially when you are on a tight budget.
