I came here with a party of 4 for brunch/lunch on a Saturday around 11 am.  There were a few other diners, but otherwise the place was quiet.  We ordered the nachos to start off which were amazing!  The nachos were sliced individually like little pizzas, so it made it easier to eat and diviude amongst ourselves.  For the main dishes 3 of us ordered the chilaquiles and the other dish ordered was the breakfast dish with chorizo.  Everyone enjoyed their meals overall and it was incredibly delicious.  We also ordered 2 horchatas which were excellent.  Overall this place is a hidden gem and we will definitely be returning!
