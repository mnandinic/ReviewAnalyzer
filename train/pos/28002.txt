Used to live in East Boston and I MISS THIS PLACE!  The BEST authentic El Salvadorean food.  The pupusas are the best I have ever had.  The staff is so pleasant, the atmosphere very cheerful and full of great energy.  Their soups are fresh and full of great flavor.  My husband always gets their burritos- delicious.  All the tacos, tortas and enchiladas are soooo good!  We always get excited when we have an opportunity to stop in or get take out.They also sell great beer and yummy margaritas that are HUGE.
