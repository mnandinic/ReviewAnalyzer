DUDE. EAT HERE. NOW.After eating here I have decided that Venezuelan is one of my favorite cuisines. This place is phenomenal. I got the parrilla caraque√±a - holy crap the flavors. Everything is seasoned perfectly and grilled to nirvana. Great amount of meat too - gotta get that protein in! And yuca is so freaking good!! It's crispy but still potato-ey and goes really well with the meat! We topped it off with the torta fluida - at first glance it seems underwhelming, but take that first bite and BOOM. MOUTH ORGASM.Coming here every chance I get!
