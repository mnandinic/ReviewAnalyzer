Another Eastie Gem. I always look for new ethnic places and saw the strong reviews here. I was really excited to try it out. We entered a semi-busy dining room and were graciously seated anywhere we want and thanked for coming. The restaurant is modern inside with hardwood floors, cool lighting. It was very clean. There is a beer and wine selection but we decided to go with their fruit drinks.We got a blackberry and mango. They were great, blended with ice and your choice of milk or water. So refreshing. Mine had milk and it tasted like a fresh berry shake. I highly suggest one with your meal.

We started with the mussels, as suggested by our waitress. They were tasty. 8 good sized mussels arrived stuffed with onion and cilantro.

I chose the Carne Asada. For $10 this plate was impressive and one of the best deals I've ever had for a delicious meal. It had a large tender grilled steak, rice, salad and plantains. It was so flavorful. The plantains on the side were crispy on the outside and soft inside. I would suggest this meal and definitely get it again.

My boyfriend got the Ceviche Mixto ($15). This was amazing. The ceviche was the best we ever had. Done true Peruvian style. It was a generous portion of seafood in a milky citrusy base. It is in a league of its own. On the side it came with sweet potatoes.

Service was friendly. Our food arrived very promptly. The waitresses were fluent in English and Spanish. The restaurant had a mix of both too. Dinner came to around $40 for an appetizer, 2 frozen drinks and 2 large dinners. We both were so happy to find Rincon Limeno. We will be back many more times.
