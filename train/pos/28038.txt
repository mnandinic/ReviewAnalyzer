This is my first time ever eating (hopefully authentic) Hispanic food, especially in this case, Columbian.+ I ordered a really popular dish recommend and ordered by 5 other friends, the Bandeja Paisa. For $12 I got this plate of food; beans, rice, plantains/platanos (I have no clue), this... Weird ball, a piece of pork chop, and this amazing fried(?) red curved piece of pork belly.+ Beans tasted like beans, not like Chipotle okay. Rice tasted a little different, like rice with more flavor, way different than Asian rice. The plantain/platano I don't know the difference but it was sweet. It was actually a really good addition to the meal because some of the food was salty and the rice was nice to de-flavor the food . The weird ball thing was like a ball of plain, dry dough.  The piece of pork chop was simply grilled. The best thing on the whole entire plate, the red curvy thing of pork belly. So good. Much flavor. Such taste. I devoured the whole thing and it was my favorite part of it. I don't know what made it so good but I want to know how they cooked that.- The ball thing of dough really threw me off I didn't understand why it was there in the first place. The pork chop was really salty but I still ate the whole thing. The weird ball is really dry and plain on the inside, I still don't know what that is but I didn't touch it again after the first bite.- The service was decent. Seated immediately, let us take our time to order, and food came out at a reasonable time. I was starving so maybe I was a little impatient. Our waitress was really nice though, recommended us some drinks (decided to pass) and some other tips about what to order.
