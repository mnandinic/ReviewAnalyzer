Clean, refreshing, and zesty fish ceviche. They've got excellent tacu tacu (we got the creamy seafood one...the first listed on the menu). We also got the plain fried yucca, which is also great. It comes with 4 dipping sauces. The green and creamy orange ones were our favorites. They let you sample chicha morada (like a sweet mulled fruity beverage) before buying. We ended up getting them, since it's only $2 a glass.

Super fresh fish in the ceviche, tender squid, beans in the tacu tacu, which is smooth & creamy. Everything was light, not greasy or heavy. The most flavorful ceviche with perfect fish & citrus & cilantro marinade.

The service was good. The server was attentive.
