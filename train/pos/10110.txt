D'Guru!  Downtown does not deserve you!

I hate that you close at 3:00 and sometimes even a little bit earlier. I hate that you never answer your phone, so I can't call everyday to find out if you're serving coconut shrimp curry. But these are the complaints of an obsessive stalker.

I love that you stash warm chapatis for me under the counter. I love that sometimes you will surprise me by sprinkling boondi in my raita. I adooooooooore your coconut milk curries.

Please never leave me.

Now, go make me a curry... an egg curry.
