The flavors are very unique to Venezuelan cuisine so if you're looking for Mexican blandness look elsewhere.  The Osso Buco is my favorite and I would have it every time if it wasn't for the specials.

Outdoor patio seating is a plus, but it was too windy for us to enjoy it our last visit.  

I would also highly recommend the cocktails, Pedro's 10 cane mojito is amazing!  Getting a flight of tequila is a great option as well.
