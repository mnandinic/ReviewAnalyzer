Have been to this restaurant many times and the service and food have always been good.  Actually heading there now when I read the previous review.  That table the previous reviewer comments on is not in the bathroom!  It is actually at the back right side of the restaurant and a larger table , with some privacy, for larger parties.  Last week I sat right across from there in a section of smaller tables, even closer to the hallway to the bathroom,  and it was very comfortable.  This is a fun place to go to eat and be entertained.  The specialty drinks are pricey but no more so than any other quality restaurant.  One on mine and my wife's favorite local places.  Enjoy.
