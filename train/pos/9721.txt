second visit in 3 years, i was here recently for work and before that 3 years ago for work. food consistency hasn't changed in 3 years - its still as amazing as i remembered it. be warned though, unless you are hispanic, the area where this is at may seem a little worrisome to white folk. no its not a racist remark just an observation of how the area could be perceived by someone of non hispanic/latino descendence.
