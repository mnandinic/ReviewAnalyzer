Taqueria El Carrizal is the best spot in Allston to satisfy the cravings of this Southwest transplant.

When I moved here from Arizona, finding a good Mexican restaurant was high on my priority list. Decent Mexican joints are a dime a dozen in the Grand Canyon state. Throw a dart and you're bound to land on a really good one.

I've tried a few different places in and around Allston and they were just okay. It's not that they were bad, they just seemed like it was someone's *idea* of Mexican food, but some things were off here and there.

The food here finally hit the spot. A legit burrito with REAL salsa--bordering on too spicy for me, which meant my partner LOVED it. I'm excited because I can get solid Mexican food AND pupusas... which are not Mexican, of course, but the ones here are better than others nearby.

Thanks for making me feel a little less homesick, Taqueria El Carrizal. I'll be back. A lot.
