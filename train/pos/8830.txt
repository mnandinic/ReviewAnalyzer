This place has amazing tasty food. Everything you get here tastes great, it is authentic and it comes with awesome service and decent pricing.
We ordered the tiradito, empanadas peruanas de pollo, and the causa rellena. Everything was great but the causa and tiradito were especially tasty. The drinks (pisco, guan√°bana and mango) were also very well done.
