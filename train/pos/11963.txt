Very good food in a comfortable and casual environment.  Excellent value to boot.  Chicharones were awesomely awesome.  It is bacon's fat, exotic cousin.  I don't even remember what I've ordered there other than that, even though I've been there 5 times.  I just pick something random and it has always been great.  Very good salsa too!
