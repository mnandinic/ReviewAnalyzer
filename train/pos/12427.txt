I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately did not enjoy the food. Ordered the vegetarian combo which comes with two sides, a naan and rice. For the sides, I ordered the palak paneer and lentils. The lentils were watery, extremely bland and under seasoned. Although the palak paneer and naan were decent, the rice that came with meal was clumpy and later gave me very bad indigestion. I would have rated this establishment a solid three stars but the lamb samosa that I also ordered tasted like windex/cleaning solution. :(
