THE EXACT OPPOSITE IF WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM INDIAN RESTAURANTS!!  
Modern. Clean. Hip. An Eat In fast food vibe.
The man who took out order was awesome and funny and insisted we sample some items before ordering, which, well, I don't know how else to say this but, I wouldn't be opposed to sleeping with him just based on that alone. But also, the food was Scrum didlyumptious!! Like, I will fight traffic and drive into the city and find a parking spot and put quarters into meter to eat here again. Is it good enough to brave the T? Ehhhhhhhh.......maybe. I mean, coconut chickpeas?!?!! There IS a god! I want to eat here at least 3 times a week for the next 74 weeks AND have them cater my wedding that I'm not having, and the baby shower that probably won't ever happen either.....unless this guy gives me more free samples!!!
