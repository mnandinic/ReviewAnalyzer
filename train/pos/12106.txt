I'm forever locked in! I used to not be a huge fan of  Latin American food but since arrival to Taqueria El Carrizal I'm the biggest fan. I first came here after a long bike ride on a hot day for a sangria to close the evening and this place looked pretty authentic. It was delicious! After that night I decided to come back for lunch and I had a fantastic pork and cheese papusa and a side of yuca (which i have always thought was hard to find) it was THE BEST. This place is underrated and should be 5+ stars. All ingredients are fresh and its fairly inexpensive!
