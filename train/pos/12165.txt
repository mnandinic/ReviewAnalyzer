I have been here a few times now and it is now my favorite place to stop for Mexican. I have all three of the pupusas -- pork and cheese, bean and cheese, and loroco (an edible flower from Central America) -- and enjoyed them all.  I have the Torta with pork, Burrito with steak, and a Flauta with chicken .. yum, yum, and yum.  Of the three, I felt the Flauta was the weakest choice ... they are rolled with chicken in it and fried.  I feel there was not enough chicken to fried tortilla ratio.
Whenever I have gone in, it has been quiet and it is a large spot for that area but looks like they do a lot of takeout.
