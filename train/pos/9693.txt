You want to try the best authentic ceviche (fish cooked in citrus marinade) in town? Then you're missing out if you haven't been to this place.  The neighborhood it's in might deter you from thinking that your meal will be unforgettable, but trust me... it's unbelievable.  I would start out with the stuffed mussels followed by a ceviche platter and finishing off with a couple or a few pisco sours. Do try!
