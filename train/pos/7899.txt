This is my go to Puerto Rican place when I'm missing my papi's cooking  I grew up eating rice and beans everyday!! I have been coming here basically my whole life, I grew up in Cambridge. While I would prefer to eat my papi's or my Tia's cooking or to be in Puerto Rico, this place is as close as it gets! I only gave it 4 stars because I don't love everything on the menu and there's some staples that I wish that they would sell that they don't (pinchos or mofongo). And sadly for me (but amazing for them) they are closed for about a month in December and July, as well as Sunday's.
   I normally like their fried or roast pork plate. The roast pork (pernil) is only available on Fridays and Saturdays. I like their regular beef party's, the chicken and cheese are a big hit at my house. I also like the stuffed potatoes and the plantains (both the sweet and the hard). Everything on the menu is worth a shot, while they don't work for my taste buds they certainly work for some of my family's!!
   There is only limited permit/meter parking so walk here, central sq is close by or just be aware that someone may need to stay in the car. There is seating, not much but probably around 12 snug tables. It's Cutely  decorated with a lot of decorations on the walls and plastic table cloths.  the family is friendly, hard working (there 6 days a week), and the father calls everyone Primo/Prima (cousin)
