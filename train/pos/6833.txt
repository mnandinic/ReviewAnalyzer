Their food here is really good, very authentic, not too greasy and prepared just right. None of that Taco Bell bullsh*t. Prices are reasonable, the atmosphere is nice, interior is very presentable and service is fast.

What sets this place apart is the quality of the service. If you get waited on the staff actually seems to care that you're enjoying yourself, and legitimately wants you to be comfortable out of kindness, not out of a desire for a tip like you seem to see everywhere else. Overall I'd say eating here is a very enjoyable experience, and if you like Mexican food you shouldn't miss it.
