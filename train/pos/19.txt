I haven't eaten pupusas in a long time, this was a great option for salvadorean food, they even have the beer from El Salvador which you can pair it with everything they serve there, it was our first time picking latin american food, and this place has a great variety from salvadorean enchiladas to coctel de conchas. I would definitely come back, the place is small, the music, you can pick what to listen, the waitresses are friendly the only downfall is how far it is, all the way to East Boston, but is worth it!
