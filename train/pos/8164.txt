this place is exactly the same as it was when i was in high school.  super cheap and tasty. the owners make you feel like you are having dinner at a friends parents house.

beef patties plantains and fried pork are world rockers are world rockers and the chicken stew will is exactly what the colder months were made for

also i really like the south american soda options
