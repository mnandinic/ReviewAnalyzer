Whether you're going for the ceviche (awesome), and/or an entree (also all great), or having a few small plates to share, Rincon Limeno never disappoints. As a hat tip to its authenticity, I had a friend from Peru in town and she absolutely raved about the place. Good pisco sours as well, and friendly and attentive staff. Definitely very different from the bevy of other good Latin American options in a mile radius. Peruvian food stands on its own, and is one of the world's treasures, and I am grateful to have a great ambassador of the cuisine in my backyard.

A ~7 minute walk from the Airport T stop (or Wood Island if you're coming from Wonderland), and there is typically enough parking in the Day Square area as well. This place has been called hidden, but a hole-in-the-wall it is not; the inside is clean and welcoming.  

Side note, I laughed out loud at the two star review from the guy who allegedly can't eat without hot sauce, but had no hot sauce at his home when he got delivery from RL. But I digress...
