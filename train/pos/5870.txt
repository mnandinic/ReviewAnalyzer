My husband and I really enjoy the food every time we go. I never get the same thing and everything I've tried is delicious. The prices are extremely reasonable and for the most part waiting to be seated doesn't take long. I would have given 5 stars but I feel the waiters should be a little more friendly and on point. The last time I went we waited about 10 minutes before anyone came to see us because our waiter was having a conversation with another waiter right near our table.
