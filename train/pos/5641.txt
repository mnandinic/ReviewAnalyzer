I am comparing this not just to the Dominican food I've had growing up, but also to the hole-in-the-wall Latino Restaurant in Jamaica Plain (with food so delicious, you'll keep going back for more).

Merengue does not have the best Dominican food, ever, but the prices are great, the servings are generous,  and the wait-staff is good. Nobody rushes you out, so you get to sit and eat in peace and actually enjoy your meal. We didn't feel rushed at all. The servings are incredibly generous. There were four of us, and only one person was able to finish her entire meal. Kudos to her-- I think she should have gotten a prize for that.

The one disappointment: no 'pollo guisado' on the menu -- a staple in Dominican households. There was plenty of chicken, but none were the traditional stew.  

$11 for steak and onions, rice, beans, and a side salad. Even though it didn't have that chicken, I can't complain about how much i paid.
