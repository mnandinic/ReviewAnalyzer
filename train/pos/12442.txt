As a curry fan i have to say the chicken curry was pretty good, i wasn't too impressed with the naan and chapati as they had been made a while ago and kept warm in foil which had made them a little soggy.
In all fairness we were there quite a while after the lunch crowd had left, maybe if we'd have been there earlier they would have been a little better.
Very friendly staff, tasty chicken curry, chicken tikka marsala was ok, rice was fresh and pakoras were crisp.
Not so much a restaurant as a diner with community tables and bench's, ok for the lunch crowd that it caters for.
I see no reason not to stop by again!
