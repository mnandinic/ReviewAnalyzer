Yummy, yummy, yummy in my tummy!

I'm only an expert on Peruvian cuisine as my 2 weeks backpacking through Peru allow me. But geez, is this country's food delicious. So when I heard Rincon Limeno was the most authentic, amazing, stromtrulescent Peruvian restaurant around, I had to try it.

Our party of 7 got the following:

Chicken Empanadas - Huge and delicious. Normally, I despise mixing sweet and salty but the raisins+powdered sugar meets salty chicken combo was superb.

Papa Rellena Con Carne - Stuffed, fried potato with meat. Um. Yeah. This speaks for itself.

Ceviche Mixto, fish and shrimp - That is, 3 of us (including me), each got one of the ceviches listed. I've never had a ceviche dish I didn't love. Seriously, bite-sized seafood marinated in citrusy juices. My inner health nut loves me today.

Arroz Con Pollo - Juicy rotisserie chicken. Wow-ness.

Arroz Chaufa de Pollo - More chicken. More wow-ness.

Ensalada de Pulpo - Yeah, that's octopus salad. With delicious tomatoes. It is so good. For reals.

Aji de Gallina - One of my dining companions kept raving about a particular garlicky chicken dish they had and mis-ordered the first time around and finally got it the second time. Thick, garlicky sauce over shredded chicken and rice. There's a party in my mouth and every garlic in the world is invited.

Alfajores - Soft, melty dulce de leche cookies. Like bite-sized foodgasms. They should eat these in space instead of those tubes of nothing.

I so wish this were closer to where I live. Or work. Want. More. Now.
