This place was surprising and impressive.

I'm pretty picky about Indian food I've found in the States and yet D'Guru does it right. The food is fresh, fast, and delicious. Plus, the offerings aren't always what you'd typically expect at an Indian takeout place in Boston or most U.S. cities (meaning--they go well beyond the Palak Paneer, Aloo Gobi, and tandoori chicken, and offered really good lentils (dal) and okra last time I went in). They were also really generous with the naan, which is always a plus.
I love the combo-style setup as well (the closest thing you can get to a lunch thali in the neighborhood) and the prices are great, especially given how fresh everything is. And extra bonus--they label everything clearly as vegan, vegetarian, or meat, so for vegans, there is no wondering whether a certain dish uses real ghee or has cream in it.

So excited to have this place down the street from the office!
