Great Indian food, lovely waitstaff!

Food: Fantastic chicken tikka masala. Most people seem to order a combo (there are different meat dishes or veggie if you prefer), which comes with a main dish and a side, a ton of rice, and naan or another Indian kind of bread if you prefer. Runs about $10 and always makes two meals for me.

Atmosphere: There are a few tables and chairs for (very casual) eating in. Not a very attractive interior; most people get take out.

Staff: The staff is really friendly and recognized me after only a couple of visits, and now after a few months knows my order before I say it.

Overall, highly recommended if you're looking for a casual and yummy lunch place downtown!
