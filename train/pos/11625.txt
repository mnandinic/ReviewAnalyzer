We came here for the first time based on a recommendation from a colleague. The restaurant has a cultural feel and the patio overlooks a beautiful common area. The staff was very friendly and provided us with direction on the many Tapas options as well as the main courses. The ceviche is a must and offers a variety of shrimp, fish and other varieties of seafood and vegetables. I had the whole haddock fish for an entree which included saut√©ed vegetables properly seasoned with the right amount of spice and heat. Overall we had a great experience and would recommend this for a couple or group outing.
