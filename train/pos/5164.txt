This place is a 15 second walk from my house, and I absolutely love it. So far I've ordered take out 4 times, and got the Grilled churrasco steak with chimichurri sauce, with a side of spanish rice. The steak is perfectly cooked medium well, it's crispy on the outside, while tender and delicious on the inside. The joy that I experience when I spread that sweet chimichurri sauce on my steak and spanish rice is equivalent to the joy I experienced when I found the perfect red lipstick at M.A.C. when I was 16 years old. As far as customer service goes, they're always wicked nice over the phone and in person, and the time frame that they give to pick up food is always accurate. Definitely go here if you're looking to devour some amazing Dominican food.
