I'm a fan of this place!

Please don't slap me, but I love this than the Indian restaurants in the vicinity. And this place is really decently priced! On both visits, I shared a family style chicken tikka masala with a friend, but it's more of a large one person portion. Not quite enough for two, which makes me slightly bitter about the name "family style" but it's still worth the money.

Their interior is really clean with quite a modern look.

I'm definitely bound back here to try their other menu items!
