When I'm in the mood for authentic Spanish food, I go to Izzy's. They are a steal compared to other restaurants that serve authentic food very similar to Dominican and Puertorican cuisine. They have special combination plates daily, but my favorite is their peppered steak plate with choice of rice and beans and/or salad (but I always sub for tostones or platano maduros). Jamaican patties are a must try as well! You get a generous amount of food for the price you pay. It definitely will fill you up; I always leave with leftovers!
