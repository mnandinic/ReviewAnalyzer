This place has stood the test of time in East Boston, located in the heart of Boston's Colombian community the food here is beyond words. It is a family owned restaurant which recently expanded. Their menu consists of typical "Paisa" food, from the region of Antioquia, Colombia. This place is amazing, one of my favorite dishes is the Toston con Todo.
