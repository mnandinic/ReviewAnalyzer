I have been to Vejigantes twice now for Puerto Rican food with my one and only Puerto Rican. The restaurant website says they are "Authentic Puerto Rican" and my Puerto Rican is the most authentic, so we went together. The first time we went, it was only us in the restaurant. Some may have taken this to be a bad sign, but we loved the privacy we had in our own private Puerto Rican island.My Puerto Rican companion ordered a few of his favorite items. I loved 3 out or 4 of them (not bad right?!). We ordered the Mofongo, Platanos, Codfish Fritters and I forget the last item. We were still early in our "eating out phase" and the experience was so overwhelmingly great that I had no choice but to rush off into an Uber right away so I could go tell all of my friends about it... it was also raining out.The second time we went was more crowded. We allowed others to join us on our island this time. We were in new levels though so we knew we wouldn't notice anyone else and still felt we were in our own island. We ordered our similar delicious items.Some of my most authentic moments with my Puerto Rican have been here at Vejigantes, for some authentic Puerto Rican food.
