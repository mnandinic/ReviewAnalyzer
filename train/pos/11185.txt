Went to Pedro's for my sisters birthday tonight, food was on point. I got a traditional Venezuelan dish and it was very good, however could have done with less salt. The steak my dad got was absolutely amazing, it melted in my mouth. Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and attentive. It was fairly busy for a Monday night.  My mom got a $12 salad, which I thought was a little pricey for lettuce, squash, and some tomato slices. The price would have made more sense if there were avocado in it. Besides that, everything else is great. Be sure to try the shrimp ceviche, sooo good and very fresh. As well as the calamari , which was quite delicious. I'll be returning soon.
