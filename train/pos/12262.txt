Guru has come to downtown Boston, and brought with it delicious Indian food, fast and casual, at a good price.  It fills the aching void between the frankly awful food-court representation at Downtown Crossing, and the two white-tablecloth options nearby, and I expect it will be a hit here.  

D'Guru offers a limited menu that changes daily: typically one or two chicken dishes, one or two goat or lamb dishes, one seafood dish, and four to six vegetarian dishes.  A lot of Indian vegetarian food includes dairy, but some of Guru's dishes are vegan and marked as such (four out of five on today's menu).  Combos include two main dishes, rice and naan and are easily big enough for two meals.   They also sell a la carte entrees and sides.  

The food is generously spiced -- not so much hot as rich in cardamom and clove and such -- so if you prefer your Indian food on the bland side, this might not be to your taste.  I like it just fine, and find it to be much less heavy than the typical Boston-area Indian food (as long as you don't lose your mind and try and eat the entire combo).  

One intangible that I'll add about this place: they seem to really love what they're doing and really care what people think about their food.  They smile and react with pleasure when people make yummy noises.  This seems like an obvious thing for restaurant staff to do, but I guess it isn't as common as you'd think, because it really stands out when it happens.  A trip to a Guru location is always a delight because of the obvious pleasure that they take in serving up their delicious food.
