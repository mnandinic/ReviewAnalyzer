Nice latin Ambience.  Corner-of-the-room singer dude and other patrons were loud as hell.  Service all kinds of slow.  Mofongo is basically offspring of mashed potatoes and unripe bananas.  Pretty good.  Chimichurri with the steak lacked tang.  It's alright.  Probably won't take the wife there again.
