Fantastic drinks, delicious food and and amazing service. La Casa de Pedro is a restaurant that you'd expect to find in downtown Boston, but lucky for you - it's in Watertown, with plenty of free parking all around.

Pedro's may be my favorite restaurant. The place is very spacious and beautiful. The decor is gorgeous and warm, filling with lights and tropical plants. It's a very nice place for a date, especially on nights where they have music.

Most amazing thing? The plantains and yucca. Or any of their tilapia, scrod or salmon dishes. Or anything with their green habanero cream sauce (ask for it!).

Edit: Adding a star. Service is still wonderful. The last time we were there (which tends to be a few times a month now), we had a charming server named William who was very friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. We'd ask for him again, if we could. But William aside, the staff is ALWAYS amazingly nice. There hasn't been a single time where our server was in a mucky mood and showed it.
