Came here late on a Wednesday for a bday date, and loved it!! I've been to the Harvard location as well, but I have to say the South End is much cuter and cozier. I got there towards the end of the night so business had definitely slowed down, but it was very quaint and welcoming.Also just want to note, that I actually wasn't very hungry and didn't order much food, but everything that we did get was DELICIOUS. The only thing I'm going to pick at here is the drinks. I forgot what I ordered exactly, but it was something with grapefruit and it tasted watery. My date had a caipirinha, all I can say is I've had better.BUT THE FOOD...1. datiles -- normally wouldn't be drawn to bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese, but I had seen all the yelp reviews about it so decided to give it a try. It didn't disappoint! So so good and such a lovely mix of sweet and savory. It's a must try.2. pernil -- the only arepa I've tried here, and quite frankly the only one I ever want to have. The meat is so flavorful and so simple with the fresh cheese. It's small but perfectly satisfying and pairs amazingly with their mojo sauce. I have no idea what the sauce is made of but it's tangy and delightful. I would love to have a bottle of this sauce for everything I make. Orinoco is known for arepas, also another must try.3. empanada -- okay, so I don't remember which empanada I ordered, but I doubt you could really go wrong with any of them. The salad that came with it was really really good, and I'm never one to really rave about a salad. I wish I asked what dressing they used, because I would love to make some myself.Anyways, come here if you want stellar, flavorful food. I can't wait to come back and explore the menu. They also have a location in Brookline, so check that one out as well!
