Found out about this place from one of my friends,and was told you MUST come here for some of the most authentic PR food you will ever have.So,we ended up going and I have to say, I was not disappointed. I order a dolce de Leche to start my visit off right. It was so delicious, I wantes to order another one! I did hold off,due to wanting to sleep that night.I got mofongo,and it was just amazing. They give you a huge helping of it,and it is just like some that I have had on the island.Their waitstaff is friendly and fast. They checked in on us to make sure everything was ok. The prices here are amazing, and the interior was so bring and fun,and  made me think of Old San Juan.Oh,do not skip on dessert. Our entire table ended up ordering flan. It was firm,yet still soft. Creamy and not too sweet. The presentation was perfect. A smooth layer or carmel without any lumps or bubble.I keep bugging my friends about this place, saying that we need to return soon. I can't wait to come back and try out more items on the menu!
