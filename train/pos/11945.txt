The Salvadoran food here is pretty fantastic. Get the pupusas with loroco (a type of flower) and cheese or beans and cheese, the chicken tamales, or the Combinacion Salvadorena. All of these are good. Skip the Mexican food served here. It's not very good and the tacos could be better. (Boston simply doesn't have decent Mexican food overall. Trust me, my spouse is from Mexico).
