Upon the recommendation of Roni E, I went here after my first day back at work.  There had been a lot of meetings and suddenly I realized that it was 3pm and that I hadn't had lunch.  So I decided to go with lunchner.

It is absolutely correct that you can get a lot of food here for 8 or 9 bucks.  I feel that Miami succeeds where El Oriental has gone astray recently.   Miami Restaurant is faster and cheaper, if not as "pretty."  The stewed chicken meal I got was great.  The chicken, rice, and beans were all good.  

And the owner was very helpful when I said.. "I'm not sure what I want, but I think I want a plate."  I'm not sure if it comes with it or if he was being nice, but I also got about 5 plantains which is enough to win me over.  I LOVE plantains.  I even bought some earlier to fry myself.  But these maduros were actually not very sweet (and no, they weren't tostones).  Although I may not get the sweet plantains again, I will most likely be back for the other food and with the bf.

Fun Fact:   There were wacky soda brands in there, including "Country Club" in the flavors of orange and raspberry.
