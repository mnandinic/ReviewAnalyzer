The restaurant was located right down the street from where my friends lived so I decided to try it out one evening. My friends, who have been here multiple times, really enjoyed the food and so did I.

The food was pretty good although ordering took some time as it was uncertain if our waitress understood everything we said. But eventually, everything worked out and we were happy with our orders.

The shrimp Quesadilla that I ordered was really delicious. I simply picked it out after a friend, who was sitting next to me, ordered it first. The presentation was wonderful as I questioned what he ordered. Although, I don't eat Mexican food often, the food was really enough to satisfy my slowly built up cravings.
