We visited boston for the weekend and found this place on groupon. We were pleasantly surprised at just how nice a place this restaurant was. We found this place through groupon. They didn't treat us like second class citizen because we used a voucher. The service was top notch and the food was just perfect, not overly seasoned and not bland. My wife complained her steak was dry, but then again she ordered it well done.

I would highly recommend to just about Anyone including my family and friends
