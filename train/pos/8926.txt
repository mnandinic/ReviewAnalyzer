This place is a hidden gem for folks that typically don't venture out to East Boston but definitely should!!  I got there around 6:30pm on a Saturday night and it was packed, luckily we were the first ones on the list.  It didn't take too long to sit but the restaurant definitely filled up as soon as we sat, LUCKY!

The place is pretty authentic and the staff mainly speaks Spanish, which I love.  I tend to always order based on what I've had and loved which is the Lomo Saltado but I got yucca fries instead of fries.  The dish was perfectly seasoned I just wish the pieces of meat were cut bigger as opposed to thin slices but needless to say the dish was huge and came with a side of rice.  We also ordered a side of sweet plantains and they were lightly fried and super sweet, perfect addition to our meal and the portion was huge, we had to take some home.

Service was great and we were not rushed which I really like.  Nothing worse than being rushed at dinner.  Perfect location, ample street parking and yummy tasty food.

Check this place out!!
