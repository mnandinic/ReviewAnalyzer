I can feel the fire start in my mouth when I think of La Casa De Pedro. Their hot sauce is absolutely amazing. Yuca + hot sauce = happy Colleen. The food is amazing too, and there are almost too many selections (the menu weighs like five pounds). I've only ever been here for lunch but it's been phenomenal every time. They also have tequila flights, which in my opinion, is the best way to celebrate. Haha! Ohhh and the plantainsssss, they're so delicious they're practically dessert. Mmmmmm.
