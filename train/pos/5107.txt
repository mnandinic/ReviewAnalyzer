I lalalalalalove merengue. First time we went, my girl and I showed up hungry, maybe even HANGRY! and ordered EVERYTHING and devoured it all. No doggy bags, unnecessary with us eating until we were uncomfortable. We came back a few weeks later (and again and again, maybe like 5 times in 6 months) and brought our 3rd partner in food crimes with, and he loved it too.
Paella, mussels app (HUGE mussels. Not a huge portion but holy crap the mussels were large and tasty ), shrimp app, lobster and plantain thing. I'm definitely going back for the paella and mussels... The plantain thing was pretty dry but it was a healthy portion of lobster. I also liked the whole fish. Their garlic sauce is AMAZING.
Dessert wise, we tried everything. Good enough, but I'd rather keep eating their salty foods. Don't save room for dessert unless you're a true sugar addict
