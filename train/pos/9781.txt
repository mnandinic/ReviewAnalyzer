I was looking for something near my hotel and this place caught my eye. I had the lamb dish. It was excellent especially with the hot green jalape√±o sauce. Happy I got a side order of their plantains and a Peruvian Malbec to wash it down. Service was good on a Monday night and this place hit the spot after a six hour flight. You can bet I will try other dishes next time I am in town.
