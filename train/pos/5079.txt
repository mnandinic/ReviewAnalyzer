OMG, even better than the food I fell in love with in the Dominican Republic. I hesitate you tell you how wonderful it is because I'd like to never have to wait for a table.

We started with a small appetizer sampler which in itself could be more than a meal. The mofongo was crazy delicious. My date had the filetilla which came with rice and a small side salad. The flavors on the steak were great. I asked if they had chivo guisado, because I fell in love with it in the DR. It's not on the menu, but they had some in the kitchen, so voila! Amazing flavor!

All in all a wonderful dining experience. Can't wait to come back when I'm missing the DR again.
