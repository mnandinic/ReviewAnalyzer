Excellent service (via Pablo our server for the evening)!
Excellent food and drinks!!!

Pablo was able to suggest our table of 7 various tapas throughout the evening which did not disappoint at all. He even brought out this amazing hot sauce and bread to try with specific things and his advice was much appreciated.

Appetizers included the Vargas, Calamari, Ceviche, Queso Fundido, Teque√±os, and Camarones al Ajillo.

Everything we tasted was amazing!
And what makes this place even better.... patio seating, you forget you're even in Watertown!

Definitely on my top places of restaurants to return!
