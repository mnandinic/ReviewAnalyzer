YEAAAAHHHHH!  So excited to have finally tried this place - AND it's in EASTIE!  
My brother, sis-in-law, and nephew were in town for a visit.  After visiting "Reaveah" Beach, we were hungry for something that could not be found in the Revere area (i.e. something NOT fried, sandwich-y, or pizza-like).  Thank goodness I live a short drive away from Rincon Limeno.
We ordered a mix of things: Vegetable Empanadas, Lomo Saltado Mixto, Mini Bandeja, Ensalada de Pulpo, Platanos Fritos, and Leche de Tigre (ordered simply because it was called...Leche de Tigre).  It was all fabulous and the portions were so generous we literally could have done without half of what we ordered.  In fact two days later, I was still eating the leftovers.  
Yelpers...go and try this place out and support another hidden Eastie eatery.  And try the Leche de Tigre - as my nephew would say - it's AWESOME.
