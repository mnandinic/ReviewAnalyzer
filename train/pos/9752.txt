Incredible, authentic Peruvian. If you have never tried Peruvian food before, this is the place to try! I recommend getting several tapas and sides to try different things. If you are staying in the Courtyard at Logan Airport, this is the best food around. I was going to try seafood places but they pretty much served fried food...here there are plenty of fresh seafood dishes.
