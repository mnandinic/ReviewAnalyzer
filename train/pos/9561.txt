In love with this Peruvian restaurant! I've been there on weekends and during the weekdays and have always been able to get a table. Food is always excellent but service is mediocre.

Few of my favorite dishes: The tacu tacu is amazing! Seafood dish with rice and its so creamy and flavorful. It really melts in your mouth. I also love the beef heart appetizer. Now I am not a huge fan of eating things like rabbit, tongue, etc but this dish is chewy and has the right amount of seasoning. I really recommend these two dishes.

Yes, the location is out of the way (hey if you have a car then you have no reason to not go!) but you will never find a place like this in the city. Two words: LEGIT & DELICIOUS.
