Love Orinoco - the food is absolutely delicious. They really get it right here. We've been several times - dine in, order out - and it is always top notch.Favorites:- Empanada Mechada: My absolute favorite thing on the menu. It is lightly fried and the beef is delicious. Bonus points for having an excellent salad accompany it. The sherry vinaigrette is light yet flavorful. The whole dish is extremely fresh and bursting with flavor. Five stars!- Fried sweet plantains are excellent as well. At most other restaurants, plantains tend to be heavily deep fried but not here. If there was a prize for "delicately deep frying" something, Orinoco would win it. Delicious.- Arepas and datiles are great as well. Ask for hot sauce on the side for the arepas, if you like things spicy.Service is wonderful too. We brought our new baby for an early dinner on the patio the other night. Per our request, they got us in and out in record time. Highly recommend!
