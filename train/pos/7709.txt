While visiting Boston, we came across this awesome food spot.

This momma and poppa place is a cosy down to earth place to eat. The goat stew was delicious, along with the Tostones and beans. My girlfriend also enjoyed her pernil (pulled pork) dinner plate. I highly recommend their empanadas, they were so good we brought a handful back to our hotel.

If you're in the mood for Puerto Rican food this is the spot.
