What can I say about La Casa De Pedro. Excellent food, great atmosphere, ample parking, great service. 5 stars.

I've been here at least 5 times and have not had a bad experience. Weekdays, weeknights, weekends,...doesn't matter. I'm literally sitting here and there is a live band playing -  2 guys, rhythm guitar and a bongo drummer, and they introduced a kazoo...yes a kazoo. I hate to give this place such high marks because I want to keep it for myself, but alas, the secret is already out.

I strongly recommend that you come here...have the 10 cane mojito, a steak based dish, and soak in everything. Awesome. I guarantee you will not be dissapointed - DanO
