Amazing! If you are craving Peruvian food/you want to try something different, then this is the place to go! I've only been here once but that's because you kind of have to go out of your way to get here. BUT it is worth it for the food! :D I had the Carapulcra (peruvian pork & chicken with dry potato sauce)  and it was yummy! The sweet plantains are also good. The waitresses are also extremely nice! Definitely recommend this place!
