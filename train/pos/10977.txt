I have been to La Casa de Pedro every so often as a special treat. The dinners are expensive, but worth every penny. The brunch is a better price.

I have always had courteous waiters/waitresses, a delicious and properly prepared meal, and a welcome feeling.

The atmosphere is great with high ceilings, beautiful interior decorating, art, and plants. The seating is nicely spread out for a quiet intimate feeling even when it's crowded.

Another huge/unexpected plus is, on Friday and Saturday nights they have a band playing, the first time I was there I thought it was a recording! They were so good!
