Excellent Puerto Rican food that is as good as you will get in San Juan! Bar is very small and seating can be cramped, but the food and atmosphere more than make up for that. Not to mention free valet service. Food prices were very reasonable with polite wait staff. The night we went there was live music, but no room for dancing. This is not a night club, but instead a high end Puerto Rican restaurant.
