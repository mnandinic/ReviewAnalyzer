I am writing this review based on take-out; I have not eaten at the restaurant.  My wife ate here recently and brought me home a mix of food including arepas, beef, pork, rice, and beans.  I found the food to be delicious!  Everything was flavorful, the meat was tender, and one thing that I really appreciate about this food is that it is NOT greasy like so many other similar restaurants.  I hope to have the opportunity to eat at the restaurant one day!
