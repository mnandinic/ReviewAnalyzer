This place has the scallion pancakes, mapo tofu, and eggplant with garlic sauce that you crave.  Hand-pulled noodles, steamed buns, and lamb with scallions are also still on my mind several weeks later.  On a Sunday evening, we were able to get a table immediately and sit for a few hours feasting until we closed the place down and stumbled out, drunk on food.  I highly recommend you try this spot if food is more important to you than atmosphere.
