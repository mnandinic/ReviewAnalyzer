So this place fills a decent gap in my heart for some quality Mexican food in my home 'hood. So glad to have stumbled into it while getting my pup washed just up the block at Modern Dog Boston.

The quality of the food delivered was outstanding. My wife and I ordered the Yuquitas Fritas, Veggie Fajitas and Pork Haurache. It looked beautiful and all tasted even better. Upon first glance the portions seemed slightly light, but the gut-busting feeling that followed showed that to not be the case.

This will be added to the regular rotation of orders we place. Very glad to finally have this gem up the street from us!
