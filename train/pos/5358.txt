One of my favorite restaurants in MA for real food. I am from the Bronx, so I know good Dominican food. They have the sweetest plaintains here and the porkchops are perfectly crispy. There is an area for large groups and small groups. You can pay with cash, credit or debit. The food is very authentic and the portions are huge...prices are inexpensive.
