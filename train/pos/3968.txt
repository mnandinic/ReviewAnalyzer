I had a great experience at this Dominican restaurant! I don't speak or understand Spanish but the menu was very clear, easy to follow and had English translations. I ordered the pork chops, spanish rice, and sweet plantain and it was DELICIOUS! The empanadas were also very good. My friend ordered a beef dish, white rice and bean sauce and was very satisfied with her meal as well. The serving of food was very generous for the price. I was so full! Despite it being busy, our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The waitresses were all very nice and approachable. Our waitress could've been a bit more attentive to our table though. The music and the ambiance was great overall. I'll be coming back to this place for sure!
