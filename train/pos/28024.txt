Outstanding..Went here the day off the marathon expecting everyone to be overwhelmed, but we were seated on the third floor and as parties finished we had the room to ourselves..service was fast!!  Mussels were absolutely delicious, we had lobster ravioli show up before we were done with the mussels and instead of leaving them, took them back and remade them when we were ready..the hostess even came up the three flights halfway through the meal to see how things were..  without hesitation try this spot..
