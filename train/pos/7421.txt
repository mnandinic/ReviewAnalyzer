We were here for vacation and were trying to find something other than fried, American food. The restaurant itself is smaller than I anticipated so right away I was a little concerned. However, the service was great and everyone was extremely satisfied with their meals. Our waiter was very accommodating and friendly when we came in with a large party. I ordered two empanadas with a side of beans. Both empanadas had great flavor, and I think I enjoyed the spice of the beef one the most. My husband got the chicken chimichanga which had an excellent filling. They had a lot more side order options than most Mexican restaurants which was a nice change. I would definitely go there again and I'm a little sad there's nothing like it close to home.
