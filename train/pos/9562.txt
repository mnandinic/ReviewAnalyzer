After recently moving to East Boston I was amazed at all of the options for authentic, fresh and tasty South/ Central American food. While you can find excellent tacos and other specialty plates on most blocks around Maverick and Central Square. Rincon Limeno stands out completely!

The last time I was there was with two friends. We split the ceviche mixto which is by far the best ceviche in all of Boston. the thing that made it so good wasn't necessarily the fish itself but the little sides that came with it (the corn kernels and potatoes).

We each had a few Peruvian beers with the meal. I chose the Seco de Cabrito which is a braised lamb stew with rice. The flavor was amazing and the lamb was fall off the bone tender.

We didn't have to wait for a seat at all and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. If you're tired of the same old same old in Eastie, this place is a refreshing alternative.
