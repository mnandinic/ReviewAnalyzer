I guess most people would pass on this place as I understand it used to be an old-fashioned Mom n Pop Italian restaurant a while ago. They infused some Latin American cuisine into the dishes and what came out was GLORIOUS!I just happened to stumble upon it as there was a 7pm open reservation on a Friday night. When does that happen last minute!We started out with muscles in a very flavorful broth, not the bland kind you are typically faced with. The size of the muscles were ample. Finished with a paiche which was served with orzo and spinach...YUMMY! The plate was so hot it felt like it went from pan to dish.Can't say enough about this place. They have a 3rd floor dining room with nice views of the city. Not too mention our meal was served by a handsome young fellow named "Fritz". How can you beat that? When will you ever get a meal served by a someone named "Fritz"?
