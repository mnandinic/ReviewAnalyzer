I didn't grow up in Puerto Rico but I really wish I did after trying this place today! I'm certainly not an expert when it comes to Puerto Rican food but this place really embodies the essence of the word "AUTHENTIC". From the guy who takes your order (I think the owner), to the cooler filled with unique soda's from around the Caribbean,  to the awesome food they serve, everything has this obvious authenticity that can't be ignored.

I work in Central and this place is a bit off the beaten path but it's well worth the trek. They have about four 30-min parking spots out front if you get lucky and plenty of cambridge parking permit spots surrounding Izzy's.

I had the stewed beef with yellow rice, black beans and sweet plantains ($10.65). Everything was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Portions are big and the prices are very reasonable as well.  

I will be back...
