A must eat restaurant!!! Came for lunch and ordered off the tapas menu. We ordered 5 dishes for the two of us and it was a perfect amout. The nachos are killer!!! And the flan is the best we have had! Our server Prabina was excellent! She made great suggestions and they were all top notch! Will deffinatly be back!!
