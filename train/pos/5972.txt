The food here is awesome! The portions are huge so you'll definitely have leftovers. I've had the breaded thin cut steak with white rice and beans (so good!) I've also had a few other dishes that were just as good. I strongly recommend trying to pi√±a colada.

The only bad thing is that the service is super slow but the good food usually makes up for it. Avoid if you're starving and/or in a rush, you will be waiting for a while.
