Full disclosure, this was only my second time trying Indian food but this place was just as good as the reviews said.

There was quite a line when I walked in around 12:30 but I was in and out of there with a huge portion of Chicken Tikka Masala within 10 minutes.

Food was reasonably priced for such a large portion. Chicken was tender and delicious. The naan was generic, which has been mention in quite a few reviews, but it was still tasty. I have already recommended this place to several of my co-workers.
