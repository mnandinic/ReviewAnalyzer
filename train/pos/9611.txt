Was visiting from Cincinnati.  Went for lunch. The place is small and it's a little hard to find a place to park but the food is amazing.  Had the ceviche mixto and jalea mixta and washed it down with a nice cold Inca Kola.  If you love seafood go with this amazing combination.  I promise you you won't regret it!  Will deff return if I travel to Boston anytime soon.
