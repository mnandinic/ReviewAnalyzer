great peruvian for a boston establishment!There are not many places in Boston that have good ceviche as well as other peruvian dishes.  This place is the best we have had so far!

Yuca was great, ceviche is awesome, the aji sauce is authentic and spicy.  They have great dishes which is nice.

The beef heart is a big salty, but still good!
It is a must try if you want real peruvian food
