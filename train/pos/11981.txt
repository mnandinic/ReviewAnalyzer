Tamales !! Thats all I have to say..the delicious tamales here !! I have actually tried every type of Mesoamerican tamale.... Mexican, Puerto Rican, Colombian, Venezuelan etc .etc.etc. this place has the best chicken tamales anywhere. Don't care what anyone says...it's those delicious hot tamales !!!  the pupusas are very good. The Mexican food isn't bad.  Only thing that sucks about the restaurant is that damn horrible reggaeton music they put.
