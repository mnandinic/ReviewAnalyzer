I am Dominican and know how Dominican food is suppose to taste. I always tasted food from Merengue Restaurant but never gotten a chance to go to the restaurant had a chance to go today the food taste like it came from Dominican Republic. The waitress was very friendly, nice, and polite. All the food I got a chance to eat was great. If you want to taste real Dominican food go to Merengue Restaurant.
