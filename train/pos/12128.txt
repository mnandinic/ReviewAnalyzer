So far this has been my favorite taqueria in Boston.

I'm from San Francisco and was depressed over the lack of decent burritos and tacos on the West Coast.  However, I had a cravin' and my chorizo burrito was spicy and delicious!!!  They are definitely authentic, which tons of great dishes.  Plus, they don't charge extra for salsa like *some* other taquerias around here (ahem, Anna's Taqueria---- salsa is a right, not a priviledge!).   The service was great and they were super nice, setting us up with complimentary chips and salsa while we waited for our take away.

Definitely coming back here next time I need a burrito or tacos... so good to know a yummy taqueria isn't a plane ride away.
