I had just been to EL Carrizal tonight for dinner and I must say I will be going back very soon. It is a very down to earth environment with a nice open and clean area. The hostess/waitress that had helped us was wonderfully attentive and hospitable. She came frequently to make sure we were doing well and did a wonderful job of making my friend and I feel comfortable.

The prices are absolutely a bargain, even if they served 1/2 the food in each dish. The food reminded me of my childhood with an absolutely amazing steak, good sweet plantains, and some of the best Horchata I've ever had. One of the sweetest servers I've ever had, and I've been a weekly regular of another restaurant for 7 years now. Great service. One of the big reasons I loved this place so much.

It is a couple blocks down from Harvard Ave., but I am an athlete. I bike 200+ miles a week and build up quite an appetite. I took home a doggy bag tonight, and I tried my best to finish my plate. I love this place and am going back with all of my room mates this weekend. You've got to try this place.
