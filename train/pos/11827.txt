Among all of the international eateries around Allston, Taqueria el Carrizal definitely holds its own.  The last time I went here I got:

-Yuca Frita con Chicharron (surprise, surprise)
-Plantanos con Crema (again, huge surprise)

The fried yucca was a little bit dry for me, but the chicharron was a tiny bit under-fried and cut into bite sized pieces (I prefer it in a long strip so I can gnaw on my deep fried pork belly).  The crema in the plantanos con crema had the same saltiness that I've come to know and love, but came in a semi-melted form that made it easier to dip as opposed to the solid form I'm used to.  

The rest of the entrees are also delicious, both M. and I were never disappointed in either the food or their prices.  Will definitely be back, especially for the plantanos.
