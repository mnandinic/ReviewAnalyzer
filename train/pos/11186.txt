I always love this place.  Great atmosphere inside and out, beautiful decor, high end food and drinks, fresh food and drinks, extremely yummy... Huge menu and more gourmet than the plain old three ingredients in different ways that most Mexican restaurants do.  I have never had a bad waiter here, but it will say that Ruben rocks...

Love this place and would love to go to their salsa nights some time. :)
