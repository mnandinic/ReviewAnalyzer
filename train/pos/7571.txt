I haven't been back in a while, but I loved Izzy's and used to go almost every day.

Plantanos maduros are always delicious. Sometimes the white rice can be crunchy, but not every time.

They always call you primo or prima and make you feel at home even if you aren't Puerto Rican.

They memorized my order and had me taken care of.

The place itself is small but if you can get a seat it's awesome.

The owner and his wife/family are sweet as can be. Empanadas and Jamaican beef patties are delicious.

Worth a trip. Kind of a dive-y place, but definitely delicious home-cooked meals.
