This place was amazing! If you can get past the neighborhood it's located in (quite sketchy at night...) the place itself is great! It's full of life with lots of vibrant colors. The waitresses are really nice, most only speak Spanish but the waitress we got was fluent in English and made me feel comfortable (as Spanish is not one of my languages I thrive at) we ordered the beef and cheese patties as an appetizer, which took forever to come out, we were pretty sure she just forgot about them because she apologized once she did bring them out, but they were good! I got steak tips with peppers and onions and rice/beans. it was phenomenal, and my boyfriend got the mofongo and some sort of fried chicken dish and that was create as well. I've tried mofongo from another place and it was wayyyy to garlic-y but this place was perfect! They also had a man singing live later on and he was great! Overall, I would
