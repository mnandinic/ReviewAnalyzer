La Casa de Pedro is a fabulous restaurant; Pedro is a born restaurateur!  The food is amazing, especially the plantains (which are consistently perfect) and the spicy ceviche (which stops me in my tracks it is so good).  We recently ordered short ribs, salmon, and haddock.  Each meal was superb and big enough for another lunch.  The ambience is beautiful and fun; the waitstaff, friendly and helpful.  Little touches keep revealing themselves: great artwork, live plants, nifty antiques, and wonderful custom china.  The kitchen is wide open, and I love just standing there watching one amazing plate of food after another take shape.  The cook staff are all alchemists.  La Casa de Pedro is a gem!
