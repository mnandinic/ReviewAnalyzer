Let me tell you, I found this place off yelp and decided to bring my dad here for his birthday. It's about a 25 minute drive, no biggie. But when we arrived, my brother was sending me to the shade realm because of exterior. It's right by a lot and it's in a little area that you wouldn't notice by first glance.There's a cute little bench outside the place that has the restaurant name carved and the interior is soooo festive. The seats are adorable and it just brings out homeland vibes.Our waitress was very attentive and nice. Complementary nachos and salsa too!We ordered bomb nachos that were mixed: chicken and beef. Very good and the jalape√±os weren't weak on their spicy level which was nice. Most of my family has carne asada and it came with generous amounts of the typical rice, beans, salad deal.Overall it's a nice place to go to and super glad I was able to prove to my brother that looks aren't everything.
