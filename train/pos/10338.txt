This place is awesome for some fast, easy Indian food! It's basically the Chipotle of Indian food, you order and pay at the counter and grab the food as it comes out. There's no fuss around service or water refills...you're in and you're out. Or in my case, I sat for a few hours and no one bothered us even though it was near their closing time.  I wouldn't say it's the most "authentic" Indian food, but when you're in that craving of something familiar and you need it FAST, BIK is a good place to turn to. We were served within 10mins and everything was on a plastic plate or paper cut so clean up was virtually zero.

Came here on a weeknight and got the tandoori chicken quarter--leg and a thigh combo with the coconut chickpea salad because of how everyone was raving about it and it did NOT disappoint! It was moist, savory and with a hint of that sweet coconut background. The chicken was well seasoned and moist. Counterpart got the tikki masala bowl and enjoyed it a lot. The bowl is a good sized for moderate hunger level or if you had a late lunch. If you've been waiting all day for some Indian food, I suggest ordering multiple orders or head somewhere that does the large plating, but if what you need is the go-to 5 items that most order at any given Indian restaurant, then this is your spot for a great price! Thanks for the hospitality and good grub, will be back!
