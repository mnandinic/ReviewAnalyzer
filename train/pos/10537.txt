We visited Miami Restaurant on Monday after the Marathon, as my husband was hungry from running 26.2 miles. It's definitely a neighborhood gem and I see why. I had the steak sandwich and a pineapple smoothie; my husband and brother had the fried chicken plate with sweet plantains and rice & beans. Everything was delicious but the beans were probably the best I've ever had. The smoothie was also really good! Staff and other guests were also really nice and welcoming!

We'll definitely visit again! So good!
