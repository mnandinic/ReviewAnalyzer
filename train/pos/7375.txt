Wow! This place is awesome! The food is great, and the service is excellent! I've  lived in the neighborhood for quite some time now and didn't get the chance to visit. Finally I went and oh boy, from start to finish it was fantastic! The food was sooo good! Not many people know, but they specialize in Mexican and Dominican cuisine. That was definitely a plus. To put the icing on the cake, they are very clean and neat! 5 stars hands down. Please visit, you won't  regret it! :) Can't wait to go back! :D I will definitely become a regular! :D
