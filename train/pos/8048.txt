To sum it up, Izzy's a place to get some good food or as close as you can get to Authentic PR Food. Where else is there to get PR food around.  Because of the atmosphere,location and environment. They cater on a fast food level, people seem like they want to be in and out with their food.  For anyone who loves to eat you know time and preparation is everything when making a great meal. One day Izzy's will have a nice 5 star restaurant with full service and you will see  the difference.
If you ask me the Prices are too damn cheap!!!!,  where can you get Rice,Beans,salad and Steak and a Drink for under $10...C'mon Son...
You go to McDonald's and pay damn nearly $8 for a bullshit combo. Have some sense and really weigh the options here. I know the family very well and fully understand what they are bringing to the table.  They been in business for over 25 Years! They Must be doing something Right!!!!  Everyone has opinions and nobody will ever see eye to eye on Taste and Likes.... JUST WONT HAPPEN.  And for the Hood Rat that made the last statement....think your wrong, the people there are wonderful and very understanding.  Check yourself!
