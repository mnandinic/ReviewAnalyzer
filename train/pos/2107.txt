This place is great. The restaurant is beautifully decorated. The walls in one of the dining rooms resembles the outside of traditional Dominican campesino (countryside) homes. Vibrant colors. Service was great. Food was delicious. Try the fried meat sampler as an appetizer or the ceviche. The neighborhood is kind of sketch and no weaksauce here (meaning I don't frighten easily). We drove from Cambridge it took about 15 mins...Mass Ave str8 down. Anyone who wants to taste authentic Dominican food (as good as it gets without being home cooked) should check out Merengue.
