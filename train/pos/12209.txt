Most authentic Mexican food I can find this side of the Mason-Dixon. Every other place I've been to believes tacos should cost 3.99 and include ground beef, not here. Traditional corn tortillas with adovada, pollo, asada or lengua for only two bucks. Throw in some tamales, pupusas, horchata and you have one happy guy. Also, you can get the makings for a michelada, which seems to be unheard of among these parts. Definitely worth the visit.
