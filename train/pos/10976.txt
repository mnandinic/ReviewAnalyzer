This was one of the best meals of 2012. Note: the hours are weird as in they close really early!

I came with 2 friends and we got the fried cheese appetizer which isn't breaded. It's fried/grilled on both sides-- UNBELIEVABLE. The yucca fries are the best I've ever had. In other restaurants they can be thick and dry but here, they are drenched in a high quality EVOO with a little pesto and combined with the cheese-- SO GOOD. Also tried the fried cheese roll up things which is like a cheese puff/spring roll. Excellent.

For entrees-- the meats have always been excellent with many sides-- rice, plantains, etc. Highly recommended. Their hot sauce is SO good-- use sparingly!!!
