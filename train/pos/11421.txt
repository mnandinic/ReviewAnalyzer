Pedro's is the best!!!  My girlfriend and I love this place.  The drinks are amazing.  The atmosphere is wonderful.  And the food is ridiculously good.

We do tapas because we like to try a bunch of things.  This time we got sweet plantain (there is another type on the menu, but we prefer these ones that taste like dessert), calamari, garlic shrimp, strip steak, and olives.  

I really cannot recommend this restaurant enough.  If you want Latin food it is easily the best in Boston.  And if you want just a fun night out there really isn't a better spot.
