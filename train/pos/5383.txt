I'm on a ketogenic diet these days, which makes it exceedingly difficult to go out to eat. My major criterion is "Does it have steak or fish that doesn't have flour on it?" And then I'm limited to that menu item, and it had better be good. At Merengue, it's very good!

I had a tender, beautifully marinated steak with a bright chimichurri sauce, peppers, and onions. It also came with a side salad and another side from a list (that included sweet plantains or tostones, fries, rice, and steamed veg) for 12 bucks.

Heads up, the waitstaff assumes you'll be speaking spanish, but they speak English too.
