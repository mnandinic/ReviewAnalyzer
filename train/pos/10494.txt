I have ordered food delivery from this place three times. First time was already so good that decided to order again and I haven't been disappointed. I have tried the chicken tikka masala, chicken korma and lamb curry. All of them tasted pretty good. Plus their way of cooking the rice is great!
Delivery was punctual every time. I would definitely recommend this place.
