Trying new restaurants is an excitement all on its on, but after hearing friends rave about this place I was beyond curious. I love that I have a chance to try a delicious meal that can bring me back to my childhood memories in Venezuela. I must say the food and the ambience blew me away. I love the lighting, paintings made it feel like you stepped into a different world. We started out with empanadas and the Stephanie's Nachos. Best nachos I've had by far. Stacked up perfectly layered with guacamole,sour cream, a fresh pico de gallo, beans, chicken, pork and so on. Every bite was just as tasty as the last. We decided to try the Steak Tacos, that came with rice and beans, plantains fried yuca, guacamole and pico de gallo. To die for! Lets just say the price makes up for the large portion too. Their margaritas are also delicious. The food was amazing, I'm already craving another chance to visit again.
