Love the location, service and the food!Working in South End means that1. I need to spend most of my paycheck on food for lunch2. Bring my own lunch and stare sadly at the food that the coworker's are eating.BUT Orinoco has great food for great price, which is why my coworkers and I go there at least once a month for lunch. They have amazing sandwiches. My favorite meal from their new updated menu is Pepito de Costillita. Which is a sandwich with pulled pork and vinegar coleslaw. It is absolutely delicious and the side of plantain chips is always nice.Their Arepas are good too, but the value is not as great as the sandwiches from their pepito section of the menu. If pulled pork isn't your thing, try their pepito mixto which has chicken and beef.If you like spicy food, make sure to ask for their hot sauce, you could either add it to your sandwich or use it to dip your plantain chips.
