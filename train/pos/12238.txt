Love at first spicy bite.

I was so thoughtfully introduced to this delicious hideaway by the owner himself. After I had met him and told him my pal Damien S loved his food, having tried Guru out in Somerville, Mr. P graciously brought me some of his delicious chicken tikka masala, along with some palak paneer, and steamed basmati rice. I was in indian food heaven. Every bite tasted of a far off land I had only dreamed of but could now grasp so tightly.

The place is located in the financial, mostly a to-go style takeaway but home to a few tables and chairs. Come up to the counter, pick your meal, and have it presented to you in a nice portable to-go container. Perfection. Transportable Indian food. Yesssssssssssssssss.
