Amazing litte gem in Eastie.  Specifically went to try the ceviche but I didn't want my husband and I to BOTH get that because that's no fun!  Stage left: Tacu Tacu.  Both dishes were outstanding.  Great flavors and very generous portions.  And whenever there are empanadas on the menu, trust and believe I am trying it.  Baked chicken empanada: que delicioso!  What you've read here is true!  These are the staples and they are fantastic, but the menu is extensive so more visits will be requried!  

The restaurant itself is very small but warm and welcoming.  It is nicely decorated and modern.  The server was very nice and super fast but we didn't feel rushed.  Overall great experience, good value and amazing food.  My husband's firehouse is around the corner so I told him he will have to make a requisite empanada stop at Rincon Limeno before coming home ;o)
