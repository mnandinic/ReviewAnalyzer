Good lord, I love this place. Unassuming and unpretentious, and the dishes are out of this world. My favorites are the oxtail and stewed goat, both perfectly seasoned and tender. Every order comes with rice, beans, and side salad. The Jamaican patties are flavorful and spicy, and highly addictive. The staff is super nice. They will set aside a quickly sold-out dish of you call ahead.
