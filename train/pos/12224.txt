Yummy food and ample portions. Cozy little restaurant.
I got the vegetable pan-seared noodles. It had vegetables that you don't always see in Chinese restaurants, including bok choy and pea pods. A little too much sauce for my preferences, but it tasted great.
They were more than accommodating of our large group.
