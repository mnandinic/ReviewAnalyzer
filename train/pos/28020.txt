This little restaurant was simply fantastic.  We came here for dinner on a Friday night with a party of three and were able to get reservations fairly easily (I booked them around 4:30pm on Open Table and got a reservation for 6).  The two drinks we got were delicious (the pisco sour and the cholopolitan). We got the mussels (which were fantastic), the lobster ravioli (good size and good amount of lobster), the orecchiette pasta (simple, but with a great mix of flavors), and the lamb shank special (perfectly cooked medium).  For dessert, we tried the guava cannoli, the hazelnut mousse, and the warm chocolate souffle cake.  All three were fantastic - the chocolate was so rich, but the sizes were well proportioned.  We also got coffee, each of which came with its own little pot of steamed milk!  That little touch, along with the wonderful service and general ambience, made this place a win.
