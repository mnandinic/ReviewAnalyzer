Me VS. the loyal lunch crowd that have been coming to Izzy's for years

Who wins? devout patrons of this wonderful Puerto Rican mom and pop restaurant AND a first timer like me cuz' everyone is treated to great food and warm hospitality

Stewed goat = A = buttery tender that falls apart with the touch of a fork, several large pieces on the bone swimming in a wonderful sauce, served with beans, tostones (savory plantains) and white or yellow rice

Meat pie = A- = sinfully flaky crust surrounding a generous portion of finely ground and seasoned beef, didn't taste frozen

Ginger beer = A++ = wonderfully SPICY and HOMEMADE ginger concoction in an Izzy'z bottle; how charming!

If you want to avoid the crazy lunch lines, come a little before noon. Whatever the case, it is well worth it. The room is filled with latino and puero rican paraphernalia that lends a nice, homey feel to the dining room
