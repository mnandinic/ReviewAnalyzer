The empanadas went well with my chili. Yes, I said it. I drowned those empanadas full of sauce. You know a place is good when they have their own homemade chili sauce. Loved it! You can even purchase the sauce but I only brought a carry on and the sauce would of gotten taken away by the TSA. Next time or if I'm that desperate I'll ask my sister to fedex some to me.
