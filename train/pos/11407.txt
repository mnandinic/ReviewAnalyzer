If you are looking for a real Mexican restaurant with fresh food, fresh drinks, and a touch of authenticity this is the place you would go to. I tried this place once in the summer and didn't like it simply because I was expecting a run of the mill Americanized Mexican restaurant. I recently returned with a more open mind, explored the menu, took in the restaurants ambiance and enjoyed a fresh cocktail. This place offers what many Mexican American restaurants don't, a touch of class and authenticity. The menu is a little pricey but if you can get past that, you will soon realize its worth the price. I will be returning to this restaurant many times.
