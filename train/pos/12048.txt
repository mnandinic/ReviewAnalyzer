I ate lunch here earlier. After eating at El Cafetal yesterday I was worried about the quality of burritos in close proximity to my house. I started off with a carne asada taco because I was waiting for friends and I was pretty hungry. It was delicious, the waitress also brought me chips to munch on while I waited for it. Once everyone arrived we got burritos. I got a chicken burrito that may have very well been the best burrito I have ever had. It was 6 dollars and I'm still completely full 6 hours later. I'm even kind of worried I might not be able to get drunk I'm so full. It was more than enough for a meal and had I not succumbed to peer pressure I probably would have brought home leftovers. Additionally the sangria albeit kind of pricey, is delicious (I don't even like sangria) and the girl that waited on us was awesome and cute as hell. I'll be spending my days off here regularly.
